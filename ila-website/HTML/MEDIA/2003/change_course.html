  A change in course?

<HR>

<p>Rate cuts in major countries outside India, such as by the Fed last
week, further increase incentives to bring capital to India. This
intensifies the pressure on the rupee to appreciate. The traditional
RBI approach, of putting currency policy first, would have suggested
that RBI should also have cut interest rates.</p>

<p>RBI policies in the last four weeks have not been fully consistent
with its traditional currency policy.  First, the European Central
Bank cut rates. RBI did not. Next, the US Fed cut rates. RBI did
not. Third, large daily changes in the exchange rate have been more
frequent in the last 4 weeks compared to the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>While the period 1 June, 2002 to 31 March, 2003 saw an average of
less than 2 days a month when the rupee moved by more than 5 paisa,
the months of May and June 2003, witnessed over 15 days such
days. While the last financial year did not see any daily change of
over 10 paisa, this year has seen over 10 such days already. </p>

<p>These things do not happen by chance. The above developments may
signal a possible change in
<i>currency policy</i> at RBI. If they do, this has implications for
questions about the exchange rate, interest rates and liquidity in the
economy.</p>

<p>In the face of higher interest differentials, what are the
alternatives before the RBI?</p>

<p>First, it could <i>continue with it's traditional crawling peg
policy</i>, where the rupee is not allowed to appreciate by more than
a certain amount. In this, it could <i>widen the daily band</i> as
seems to be happening. It could even allow rupee appreciation of 20
paisa/day or 30 paisa/day. Under this option it would continue with
sterilized intervention that has defined its policy framework in
2002-03.</p>

<p>The second alternative could be to continue intervening to keep the
rupee within a band, but to discontinue its policy of sterilisation.</p>

<p> Third, it could shift to
<i>a floating exchange rate regime</i> and not intervene in the forex
market. This would mean that the rupee would become a truly
market-determined, random walk, exchange rate.</p>


<p>The first option, of preserving the status quo, is becoming harder
to maintain. It requires more intervention, more purchases of dollars
by the RBI and more sterilization of foreign exchange assets to keep
domestic money supply under control.</p>

<p>Suppose the RBI continues to intervene in forex markets, even while
broadening the band in which the rupee is allowed to move. Given the
interest differentials with international rates, capital inflows
would continue. A mere doubling of the amount by which the rupee is
allowed to move will not change the picture significantly. </p>

<p> The RBI's exchange rate policy would require it to purchase
dollars as it has been doing in the last 12 months. Then, it could
either continue to sterilize its intervention, or it could let the
increase in foreign exchange assets lead to an increase in reserve
money growth.</p>

<p>This brings us to the second alternative. That RBI could continue
intervening but stop sterilizing the impact of the build-up of its
forex assets. The policy of sterilising inflows is usually followed
when there is fear of inflation in the domestic economy. Under such
circumstances central banks are willing to bear the costs of replacing
low interest earning foreign bonds by high interest earning domestic
bonds. But, if the fear of inflation is low, the cost of sterilising
the inflows may not be justified.</p>

<p>Moreover, even if the costs of sterilised intervention on the
balance sheet of the central bank are low, the policy has a cost in
terms of hindering the normal self-correcting market process to
work. Without sterilisation, currency intervention would lead to excess
domestic liquidity, lower domestic interest rates, and hence reduce
the compulsions driving capital inflows. With sterilisation, liquidity
in the economy is not allowed to increase and the reduction in
interest rates that the market may have brought about to reduce the
interest differentials, does not take place.</p>

<p>In the months since June 2002, when the rupee has been slowly
appreciating, the RBI consistently sterilized its foreign exchange
interventions till January 2003. However, open market operations by the RBI
have been significantly lower since then and data available till April
2003 suggests that net RBI credit to government has increased from Rs
1,13,913 cr on April 25, 2003 to Rs 1,19,304 cr on June 13,
2003. Net foreign exchange assets and reserve money have
both grown by Rs 20,000 crores over this period. This suggests that
RBI intervention was not sterilized in this period. </p>


<p>If this is true, and further purchases are also not sterilised,
and/or other counterveiling measures to reduce liquidity sufficiently
are not undertaken, then there would be an increase in money
supply. Excess liquidity in the market may not necessarily be
inflationary but does pose other problems, such as the impact upon
domestic asset prices. Thus, the policy of widening the band or even
giving up sterilizing may not be first best.</p>

<p>This brings us to the third policy option: that the RBI could stop
intervening in the forex market and not keep buying more
dollars. First, this should correct any misalignment of the exchange
rate, if it exists. If, as RBI and many analysts argue, there is no
misalignment, then this can hardly do any harm.</p>

<p> Second, if this does lead to a sharp appreciation of the rupee,
compared to the slow appreciation that is being enforced by the
current regime, then also it serves an important function. It ends
expectations of further appreciation. This would prevent capital
inflows that could be flowing in due to expectation of rupee
appreciation.</p>

<p>A significant amount of the short term funds seem to have flown
into India in the last 12 months on the expectation of an
appreciation. It is likely that this money will leave once
expectations of a rupee appreciation abate. When the exchange rate is
seen to be at an equilibrium level and hot money has left the system,
expectations should become more neutral. In addition, once the hot
money leaves, RBI's forex reserves will be at more sensible
levels, and consistent with the role of reserves as insurance.</p>

<p>While on the one hand, many economists would still argue that it is
important to keep the rupee weak to push India's exports, on the
other, it is also true that today a stronger rupee would make imports
cheaper and allow greater import of capital goods and oil that could
give a boost to the domestic economy. The investment stimulus that
could arise from this could, in principle, be stronger than that
arising from a weaker rupee. As the costs of fighting against the wind
to keep the rupee weak grow, it appears to be an increasingly
attractive option.</p>
