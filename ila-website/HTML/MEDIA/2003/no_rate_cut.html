<h1>
  No rate cut
</h1>

<HR>


<p>Last week, after an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank
and market expectations of a cut in the repo rate, the RBI issued a
statement saying that despite market expectations, it does not plan to
cut the repo rate in the near future. The reason given was that
inflation rates in India were higher than in Europe.</p>

<p>This statement gives rise to a a number of interesting
questions. The first issue is RBI's reading of market expectations
that it would cut the repo rate. Interest differentials with
international rates are already high. With the forward premium being
low, investors can be fully hedged and bring money into India. With
the RBI already buying up dollars, as it struggles to keep movements
in the exchange rate within small bands, anything that puts more
pressure on the rupee to get stronger, should logically be countered by
the RBI. In this case, an ECB rate cut at a time when the 91 day
treasury bill rate had been pushed to below the repo rate, naturally
raised expectations of a rate cut.</p>

<p>RBI has raised the issue of inflation differentials. In the case of
short term fund flows this is not important. Does an NRI investing in
a 6-month rupee account, an FII investing in a 3 month treasury bill
or a fully hedged corporate borrowing abroad need to worry about the
fact that inflation in India is higher than in Europe? The inflation
differential is important either when it creates expectations of a
nominal rupee depreciation due to an appreciation of the real exchange
rate, or if the money is to be spent in India.</p>

<p>Or, it could be that the RBI meant that reducing interest rates, or
an expansionary monetary policy, could be inflationary? There could be
an argument that when our inflation rates are already higher than
international rates, we cannot afford even higher inflation. But the
credit policy claimed that the recent increase in the inflation rate
is not a monetary phenomenon. Money supply growth in the last 12
months has been strictly under control. Despite the huge increase in
its foreign exchange assets, the RBI's sterilization measures have
kept reserve money growth and M3 growth in check. Supply shocks in the
form of an increase in petroleum and edible oil prices is a more
likely explanation of the recent inflation, than monetary policy.</p>

<p>So, if we are not convinced by the RBI's inflation differential story
as the reason for not cutting repo rates, what else could lie behind it? Is
it that the RBI is finally coming around to de-emphasising the policy
of containing exchange rate volatility? Is this the first step towards
not subjugating domestic interest rate policy to exchange rate policy?
Or, is it merely that this time cutting the repo rate was not as easy an
option as it seemed? It could also be that the RBI feels that it can 
continue to manage exchange rate volatility without necessarily having
to change interest rates by continuing its policy of sterilised
intervention, at least for another few billion dollars. </p>

<p>What is wrong with the policy of reducing exchange rate
fluctuations by inducing interest rate volatility? First, the reasons
for containing exchange rate volatility that may usually be quite
convincing for an emerging economy, may not hold for India. In
economies where the traded sector has a large share, and where
exchange rate movements have a significant impact on prices, it may be
prudent not to allow fluctuations in exchange rates. Fixed exchange
rate regimes could be a means for emerging economies to implement
inflation control. However, cross-country evidence does not
unambiguously support the hypothesis that exchange rate policies are
very effective. There is also no clear evidence to indicate that
exchange rate volatility reduces trade. In India, while in the
case of petroleum products exchange rate fluctuations may cause
significant price volatility, in general this is not a major factor in
the determination of prices, at least not so far. Thus, relatively
higher exchange rate volatility is unlikely to directly affect the
vast majority of the people.</p>

<p>On the other hand, interest rate volatility directly affects the
majority of businesses and households. While changes in rates on loans
may put into disarray a large number of business plans, households
tempted into borrowing when interest rates are low (but often at a
floating rate) may find themselves in trouble when rates go up. At the
same time, retired folks dependent on interest income on their savings
will find their incomes fluctuating with interest rates. If the
fluctuations in income are higher due to interest rate movements, than
due to exchange rate volatility, then there may be case for reducing
the emphasis on containing exchange rate volatility. Higher volatility
of interest rates also increases the risk exposure of banks and other
financial intermediaries and could result in higher cost of capital as they
try to hedge their risks.</p>

<p>The politics of the policies are no less important. The impact of
interest rate changes is highly visible. Not surprisingly, the
interest rate on the PPF has been a major political issue. Labour
minister Sahib Singh Verma's recent decision to not cut the EPF rate,
despite having to dig into reserves, is a result of such political
considerations. The fact that BJP's constituency, the voters and the
cadre, are the same ones who wanted Yashwant Sinha out of the finance
ministry because he proposed to cut the small savings rate, would be a
factor. A downward movement of interest rates would be unpopular with
these highly vocal segments.</p>

<p>The impact of exchange rate volatility is not so visible and
unpopular. This is even more true now when there is pressure on the
rupee to appreciate. First, a stronger rupee is not associated with a
false sense of loss of national pride, the way a depreciating rupee
has often been. Second, appreciation reduces prices of imported
goods. Oil has become cheaper with the rupee appreciating. Of course,
there will always be exporters who will hurt when the rupee
appreciates. In the last decade India needed to expand exports and
keeping the rupee weak was important. But today it is time to
re-examine this policy, especially when it could actually adversely
impact the domestic economy and a large number of household incomes
and business plans.</p>

<p>Until recently, the rupee has been exhibiting the lowest exchange
rate volatility among the nations who claim to have a floating
exchange rate (only after Malaysia) and the volatility of interest
rates and reserves is 4 times that in the US. If the RBI is going to
now shift emphasis away from exchange rate stability towards
reducing interest rate volatility, the outcome is likely to be welfare
enhancing. </p>
