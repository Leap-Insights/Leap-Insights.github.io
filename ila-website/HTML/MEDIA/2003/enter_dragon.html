<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The sharp
increase in India’s exports of over 20 per cent this year is certainly good
news. But whether this growth is sustainable or not depends upon what explains
it and that remains a puzzle. The mystery is that this has happened in a year
when world GDP and trade are not buoyant and the Indian rupee is appreciating against
the USD. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The first
obvious explanation is the low base effect or the decline in exports last year.
During April-December 2001 exports had fallen by nearly 2 percent. Had they
risen by the targeted 12 per cent, growth this year would have been lower. In
other words the 20 percent would have been down to 10-12 per cent and exports
would have appeared to be on track, rather than sharply up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Newspaper
reports of an astounding export growth to China of 86 per cent dominated the media.
This further raised questions about the composition and sustainability of India’s
export growth. But before we look at this in some detail, we should note that
it is significant that India’s exports to other major trading partners and
regions also grew. For instance, exports to the US, which receives one-fifth of
India’s total exports, grew at 30 per cent. Exports to Europe, where a fourth
of India’s exports go, grew at 15 per cent. The Middle East, which gets 12 per
cent of India’s exports, saw export growth of 36 per cent. Since these
constitute a bulk of India’s exports, total export growth was high.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Asia,
excluding the Middle East, constitutes about 30 per cent of India’s total export
market. Though mainland China has a share of only 3.3 per cent in India’s total
exports, a large share of India’s exports to Hong Kong (with a share in India’s
total exports of 4.3 per cent), Singapore (2.9 per cent), Taiwan (1 per cent )
also go to mainland China. It would not be inaccurate to assume that 8-10 per
cent of India’s exports are going to China!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>If these
are growing as sharply as reports suggest, it is good news for India. However,
we need to be careful before interpreting the data. Since exports to China
have, in earlier years, been taking place through the port of Hong Kong, the
development of new ports in China has resulted in the shift of this trade from Hong
Kong to China. Since trade data (DGCIS) is available for Hong Kong and China (as
also for Taiwan) separately, looking at only the figures for China gives us an
over-estimate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>So, for instance,
if we look afresh at the April-December 2002 figures we find that due to the
fall in India’s exports to Hong Kong, export growth to Hong Kong and China
taken together rose by only 23.8 per cent. Note that this figure is slightly lower
than <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>growth to India’s other export destinations.
And, indeed it is much lower than the much publicized and misleading 86 per cent
growth! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is also revealing
to look at how grossly inadequate it is to look at just the figures for China.
Indian exports to China in April-December 2001 were worth USD 676 million. To
Hong Kong, from which estimates suggest that over three-fourth of imports are
destined for China, the corresponding figure was USD 1669 million. This year
(April-December 2002) exports to China increased to <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>USD 1260 million. Hong Kong’s share stands lower at USD 1643
million. This is still more than our export figures for mainland China. The
same trend can be observed for the past three years. While growth to China has been
strong, when we combine the figures for Hong Kong and China, export growth has been
much more moderate at 14 per cent in 2000-01 and a decline of nearly 5 per cent
in 2001-02. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>What do
these figures indicate about India’s balance of trade with China? Again we look
at <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>India’s imports from China and Hong
Kong. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Here we only refer to official
trade, of course, as data is not available for illegal trade. Accounts suggest
that this trade, which takes place through India’s porous borders with Nepal
and Bangladesh, is quite significant, but unfortunately there is no reliable
data source for this. In the period April-December 2002 imports from China and
Hong Kong grew at 38.6 per cent, faster than the growth of Indian exports.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Interestingly,
the balance of trade has been in India’s favour as <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>India’s exports to China and Hong Kong in April-December 2001
stood at USD 2345 million, while imports to them were USD 1972 million. The balance
of trade surplus declined this year due to the higher growth in imports, but
remained positive. India exported merchandise worth USD 2903 million while
importing USD 2732 million. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>What does
India export to China? The country-wise commodity composition figures available
are for 2001-02 and there may have been some changes in the trade basket in the
last one year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The main
cause for concern for the last three years has been that the share of value
added goods in the basket of India’s exports to China remains low. So, for
instance, iron ore constitutes India’s biggest export item to China. On the
other hand, imports from China as well as from Hong Kong were dominated by
imports of electronics. But, again, if we look at India’s exports keeping in mind
that a significant part of goods destined for China are showing up as exports
to Hong Kong, we see that Hong Kong is India second biggest export destination
for manufactured goods. In 2001-02 India exported manufactured goods worth USD
2298 million to Hong Kong and USD 463 million to China. Ores and minerals exports
to China and Hong Kong are at a lower figure of <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>USD 1238 million.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In recent
months reports of exports of steel and pharmaceuticals to China have increased.
The construction boom in China could be offering new avenues for Indian
industry. Even though a large part of the export boom to China is not really a
boom but only a shift from Hong Kong to China, the country’s needs for products
it does not produce in adequate amounts could provide a potential to Indian exports.
However, as Western companies relocate production to China, it would not be
surprising to see India importing less from the US and EU and more from China.
Also, if Indian companies start relocating to China at a much larger scale than
has happened in the last couple of years, then again the trade surplus could
easily change into a deficit. But then, perhaps, looking at only merchandise
exports is looking at a partial picture. After all, it is the service sector in
which India’s productivity is rising. While India loses competitiveness in
merchandise production and export to China, it is likely to retain its
competitiveness in software exports that far exceed those of China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
