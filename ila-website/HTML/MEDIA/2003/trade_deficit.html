  Trade deficit: Boon or bane?

<p>The latest quarterly data on balance of payments released by the
RBI last week, reveals a new development: <i>After six consecutive
quarters of surpluses, India recorded a current account deficit of $
1.2 billion in the quarter April-June 2003.</i> </p>

<p>Trade deficits are generally considered bad news in India. We have
a long history of distress owing to large trade deficits. Many people
have vivid memories of "shortages" of foreign exchange, and the mere
mention of a 'trade deficit' sets alarm bells ringing. But in the
present situation, is this really bad news? How do we interpret this
news, and what does it foretell?</p>

<p>In the quest for answers, let us first look at the sources of
change in the current account. Exports grew at 12 per cent in the
first quarter. Net invisibles continued to do well: They grew from $
3.2 billion in April-June last year to $4.65 billion in the first
quarter this year.  What changed, to cause a larger trade deficit, was
a sharp rise in imports.</p>

<p>Exports were at $13.5 billion during the first quarter of 2003-04
compared to $12.0 billion in the first quarter last year. This was a
decent, though not stellar, performance. However, imports shot up to
$19.4 billion against $14.8 billion during the quarter. With a sharp
surge in imports but not in exports, the trade deficit during
April-June 2003 widened to $5.85 billion, as against $2.75 billion
during the corresponding period of 2002. Given the net invisibles
earnings during April-June 2003 of $4.65 billion, the current account
recorded a deficit a deficit of $1.2 billion.</p>

<p>A rise in imports might be worrisome when it is caused by external
shocks such as a rise in higher oil prices. However, import figues
show that during April to August, what really changed was non-oil
imports, which rose sharply by 28 per cent.</p>

<p>Commodity-wise imports available till May show that major non-POL
import items were vegetable oils, yarn and fabrics, medicinal and
pharmaceutical products, organic chemicals, electrical machinery,
machine tools, non-electrical machinery, electronic goods, gold, iron
and steel, manufactures of metals, non-ferrous metals, paper board
manufacturers, synthetic rubbers and wood and wood products. Imports
of these items were higher in the range of 32-89 per cent. </p>

<p>Non-oil imports such as those listed above are leading indicators
for growth in industry. They increase when domestic and/or export
demand is strong. The sharp rise in non-oil imports over April-August,
hence, bodes well for the economy. The reasons for the increase in the
deficit are, therefore, factors that indicate the good health of the
Indian economy. If there was a slump in imports growth, we would be
bemoaning it!</p>

<p>The second reason why we may argue that the current account deficit
is not a bad thing has to do with India's development strategy. India
hopes to attract foreign capital and absorb it, so that the investment
in the country is not constrained by the availability of domestic
savings. The saving-investment gap is equal to the current account
balance.</p>

<p>A current account deficit will be observed when domestic investment
exceeds domestic savings. It means India is importing capital. On the
other hand, a current account <i>surplus</i> indicates that India is
<i>exporting</i> capital. A current account <i>deficit</i> is thus
consistent with India's target of higher investment to achieve 8 per
cent growth. There would be something puzzling about India
<i>exporting</i> capital when we wish to invest more. </p>

<p>Unlike the countries of East Asia who may not need to import
capital because of their high domestic saving and investment rates,
India cannot sustain a policy of exporting capital or current account
surpluses, and simultaneously obtain high rates of investment. This
means that while we do want exports to be an engine of growth, the
growth in imports has to be yet higher. From the perspective of growth
in India, it appears that it would be desirable to run a current
account deficit of around 2.5% of GDP. This would augment domestic
savings and serve to improve domestic growth.</p>

<p>The third reason why a current account deficit may, in the present
circumstaces, be a boon, is because of the implications it has for the
problematic inflow of dollars. Surpluses on the current account have
been adding to dollar inflows on the capital account creating further
pressure on the rupee to appreciate. To prevent appreciation of the
rupee dollar rate the RBI has been purchasing dollars and adding to
reserves.</p>

<p>Very often these days people ask the question, <i>How can India
best use her forex reserves?</i> We periodically hear notions of using
reserves to build infrastructure in India. The best answer lies in
precisely how they were `used' in the first quarter: to pay for a
current account deficit resulting from high growth in non-oil
imports.</p>

<p>Trade data, for the fuller period of April-August 2003, indicates
that export growth slowed down in August. One of the causes that is
immediately attributed to the slow down is the exchange rate. However,
since the rupee appreciated nominally versus the US dollar, and
against East Asian currencies, but not in terms of the REER, it is not
easy to say clearly what was the impact of exchange rate changes.</p>

<p>During April-May 2003, exports of four major commodities -
non-basmati rice, cotton yarn, fabrics & madeups, readymade garments
and gems & jewellery - were down as compared to their exports in
April-May 2002. It may be too soon to say that export growth is on its
way down and that the nominal rupee appreciation is responsible for
this. For example, the export of rice is a function both of domestic
availability and government restrictions. Gems and jewellery are value
added exports and nominal rupee dollar appreciation impacts both
imports and exports. It is not obvious that nominal appreciation would
negatively impact exports because imports also become cheaper. </p>

<p>In summary, we should be careful to stay away from the psychology
of shortages of hard currency. India is now at a point where we earn
hard currency revenues of $100 billion a year - comprising $55 billion
of goods and $45 billion of services. We need to be clear-headed about
this question, and rejoice in a current account deficit. A current
account deficit means that the world is willing to give us goods in
return for our securities. We should seek to steadily run up a current
account deficit of roughly 2.5% of GDP.</p>

<p>It is important at this juncture that exporters are not allowed to
use the bogey of the current account deficit to create a scare and
demand that the rupee dollar rate not be allowed flexibility. This
policy has clearly been counter-productive as it caused speculative
inflows into India and added to the upward pressure on the rupee. If
the rupee had been allowed more flexibility during 2002, the capital
inflows that have been taking place on the back of the expected
appreciation might have been prevented. These have only added to the
pressure on the rupee to appreciate and thus to the woes of
exporters.</p>
