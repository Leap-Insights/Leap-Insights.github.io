Evidence from imports</B></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">by Ila Patnaik. (This column appeared
in moneycontrol.com in Jan 2003)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is the Indian economy showing signs of
revival? Every little piece of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">evidence that suggests that growth is
looking up helps to generate</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">optimism and improve confidence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In thinking about growth in the Indian
economy this year, the big</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">question is that of the impact of the
monsoon. It was mainly the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">differences of opinion about the impact
of the monsoon that led to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">growth forecasts for the economy
varying from 3 per cent to over 5 per</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">cent.  The Kharif crop is showing a 19%
drop in foodgrains, a 25% drop</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">in oilseeds, a 5% drop in sugarcane and
a 22% drop in cotton.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The bad monsoon is expected to hurt GDP
directly through lower</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">agricultural output, and it is expected
to hurt industry and services</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">indirectly through its impact on
consumer spending of agriculturists.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The early months of this year have
shown surprisingly good output</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">growth. But this is partly because the
impact of the poor south-west</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">monsoon would show up from October
onwards, in the period of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Kharif harvest. Hence, the most
important thing to track in the Indian</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">economy this year is the performance
from September to December.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Imports are one piece of this puzzle.
Imports growth has been sluggish</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">for an extended period, reflecting weak
domestic demand. In the first</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">four months of the year, we saw dollar
imports grow by 1.6%, -0.4%,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0.2% and -5.0%. This is a picture of
sluggish imports growth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, in August, imports grew by 11.1%.
In September and October, we</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">have seen remarkable growth of 30.9%
and 32.9%. This is a surprising</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">and important new development. Though a
part of the sharp rise in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">growth is the low base effect as trade
had fallen sharply in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">months of September and October last
year due to the September 11</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">attacks, the is still a significant
increase in growth.  In September</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">and October, imports exceeded $5
billion a month (the first time</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Indian imports crossed $5 billion in a
single month).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Was it simply caused by a rise in oil
prices? This appears to be true</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">in part. Over April-October, overall
imports grew by 12.5%, but</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Non-POL imports (which account for
two-thirds of imports) grew by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">10.1%. Hence, while the rise in oil
prices mattered, it is not the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">dominant explanation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Was it a rise in exports of
import-intensive goods, such as gems and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">jewellery? The data shows that in
September and October, exports only</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">grew by 7.8% and 9.9%, and that they do
not constitute an acceleration</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">in exports growth. Hence, this
explanation does not seem to explain</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the outcome.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We may hence tentatively suggest that
the imports growth of September</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">and October this year suggests
surprisingly good strength of domestic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">demand and of a smaller impact of the
poor monsoon on the Kharif</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">harvest and purchasing power.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This sharp imports growth also has
consequences for the currency</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">market. These two months have
experienced a trade deficit of $1.1</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">billion and $1.4 billion respectively.
One of the consequences of low</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">import growth has been the higher
supply of dollars in the forex</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">market and a pressure on the rupee to
appreciate. To keep the rupee</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">competitive the RBI has been buying up
dollars and accumulating</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">foreign reserves even after the level
of reserves has been assessed</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">to be adequate. Higher imports,
therefore, not only indicate that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">demand in the economy may be picking
up, they also help correct future</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">demand imbalances that may be created
because of currency</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">misalignment. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The data shows some evidence of this
also. Reserves accumulation over</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">September and October was $2.5 billion,
whereas in the preceding two</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">months it was $3.6 billion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In summary, there is something
interesting and important going on in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">terms of the imports data of September
and October of this year. This</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">is one of the first indicators that is
released, which gives us some</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">sense of demand growth in the domestic
economy. This data suggests</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">that the poor Kharif crop has done less
harm to growth this year than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">might otherwise have been expected.</P>
