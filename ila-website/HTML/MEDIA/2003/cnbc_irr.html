<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The sharp decline in interest rates on
government bonds in the last</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">couple of years has lead to a huge
increase in profits of many</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">banks. In 2001-02 the net profits of
scheduled commercial banks</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">increased by 81 per cent over the
previous year. The numbers for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2002-03 are likely to be equally high,
if not higher.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If two years ago one looked at the
situation very cursorily it might</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">have appeared that banks would lose if
interest rates go down. In</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">fact, about a year ago a lot of banks
appeared to be worried about</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">cuts in the bank rate by the RBI. They
seemed to think that this would</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">lead to a reduction in their interest
income from loans while the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">interest they pay out on deposits would
not reduce correspondingly,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">because of factors such as the fixed
savings account rate and the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">general downward inflexibility of
deposit rates. This, they felt,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">would reduce their net interest income
and affect their profits</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">adversely.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This perception turned out to be wrong
mainly because banks and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">analysts were then not able to fully
comprehend the extent of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">impact of interest rate movements on
the value of their large holdings</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">of government bonds. This is not
surprising because the regime of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">volatile interest rates and especially
downward movement in interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">rates is relatively new in India. It is
only after 1993 that interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">rates were allowed to be market
determined.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Though rates have declined sharply, it
is not possible that they will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">keep on falling forever. The question
today is : What will happen if</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">interest rates were to start going up?
How will bank balance sheets be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">affected? What would be the impact on
bank equity in such an event?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Let us imagine a bank that has Rs 10 of
equity. It borrows Rs 90. Let</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Rs 40 be demand deposits while Rs 50
are time deposits. Say time</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">deposits have an average maturity of 2
years which is offset by loans</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">of this maturity. So on the asset side
of the bank are Rs 50 of loans</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">and Rs 40 of Government of India bonds
which the bank holds partly as</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">SLR requirement and partly because it
is unwilling or unable to lend</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">in the market.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The maturity of the bonds being held by
the bank determine the impact</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">of interest rate changes on the value
of its bond holdings. Bonds with</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">long maturities have a steeper
price-yield curve than bonds with</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">shorter maturities. Thus maturity
itself is not adequate to tell us</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the interest rate senstivity of a bond
price.  To examine the impact</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">of interest rate movements we define
'duration' which takes into</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">account the times payments are made. If
a bonds has a duration of 10</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">years a one percent change in the
interest rate changes the bond price</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">by 10 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In our bank suppose the average
duration is 10 years and there is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">a 100 bps increase in interest rate
then the value of bond holdings of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the bank decline by 10 per cent of Rs
40 or Rs 4. If these are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">unhedged by changes in the value of
liabilities then this constitutes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">a hit to equity capital of 40 per cent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Banks in India, especially a number of
public sector banks, hold GOI</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">bonds of long duration. The focus of
both the stock market and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">regulation has until now been on credit
risk and the significant</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">interest rate risk exposure of banks is
not always being assessed</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">properly. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a recent study, Ajay Shah of the
Ministry of Finance and I have</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">tried to measure interest rate risk of
Indian banks. Examining</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">accounting data showing maturities of
assets and liabilities of banks</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(as presented in the annual report of
banks) we find that in a sample</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">of 42 banks at least 25 stand to lose
more than 25 per cent of their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">equity when interest rates move by 320
bps. These include banks such</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">as Dena Bank that stands to lose 96 per
cent of its equity in such an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">event, Vijaya Bank that stands to lose
80 per cent and Bank of Baroda</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">that stands to lose 41 per cent of
equity.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> Is the stock market taking adequate
notice of this? While for some</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">banks the stock market seems to be in
tune with the accounting data</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">assessment of interest rate risk, in
other cases, the interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">senstivity of bank stock market prices
to changes in interest rates is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">very low. So, for instance, for Vijaya
Bank and the Bank of Baroda the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">stock market sees significant
sensitivity of stock prices to interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">rates, while for Dena Bank it does not.
Interestingly, while</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">accounting data for UTI shows no
significant interest rate risk</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">exposure, the stock market believes
that the exposure is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">significant. A paper based on the study
is available at</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">http://www.icrier.org/publications.html.wp</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The results of the study clearly
suggest that there is a need for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">better information, measurement and
analysis of bank balance sheets.</P>
