<h1>
  ECB limits
</h1>

<HR>

<p>The logic of restricting capital inflows into India originally came from
issues about our ability to handle debt servicing and the reversal of 
flows. Today, our large level of forex reserves make that argument
redundant. However, we have a new problem which may tempt the
government to continue with the current ECB limits. This is the problem of
excess capital inflows which are putting an upward pressure on the
rupee.</p>   

<p>These inflows are a result of the RBI's currency and monetary
policy. The period since June 2002 has seen pressure on the rupee to
appreciate. By keeping daily movements of the exchange rate between
the US dollar and the Indian rupee restricted to a narrow band of
about 10 paisa per day, the RBI has created expectations of slow
appreciation of the rupee. Forward premia have reached historically
low levels. This has made it possible for a firm to exploit
interest differentials between India and international markets while
being fully hedged.</p>

<p>Instead of imposing administrative controls, MoF and RBI have the
option of using the market mechanism to tackle capital inflows. One,
the forward premia should better reflect the interest
differentials. This can be achieved by managing currency
expectations. If the rupee is allowed to be more volatile, it would
soon reach a level where further appreciation would not be
expected. While this could create some turmoil in the market, it is
unlikely to create a crisis given our large reserves position. The
change in expectations would not only reduce hedged dollar borrowing
by firms, it would also reduce unhedged dollar inflows such as by
NRI's.</p>


<p>Second, domestic interest rates need to be reduced to lower the
interest differentials. While international interest rates have come
down sharply, interest rates in India have not moved
correspondingly. While this was not a problem when the Indian economy
was a closed economy, today's open level of capital account openess do
not allow the RBI to pursue both a highly managed rupee and an
independent monetary policy with the same ease. It is important not to
revert back to controls like FERA which inevitably create illegal channels,
but to alter incentives in the market.</p>
