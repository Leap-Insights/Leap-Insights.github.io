<h1>Lazy bankers</h1>

<p>Growth in non-food credit has been slow despite the pick up in the
growth of the manufacturing sector this year. At the same time,
commercial bank investments in government securities are higher than
reserve requirements . Does this indicate that there is no demand for
bank credit at current interest rates, or does it suggest that banks
prefer to invest in government bonds than to lend to industry?</p>

<p> Maybe, a little bit of both. This could partly be due to
corporates borrowing abroad cheaply, however this is not a complete
explanation. All borrowers are not able to borrow in international
markets. So what explains the lack of bank credit growth at a time
when industry appears to be on a path to revival?</p>

<p>Given the large fiscal deficit and the huge appetite of the
government to borrow, it seems that banks are taking the easy way
out. Some months ago, Deputy Goveror RBI, Rakesh Mohan, criticised
banks in India for being 'lazy bankers', which consists of buying
government bonds beyond reserve requirements. What are the compulsions
driving 'lazy banking', and what are its consequences?</p>

<p>One 'standard path' towards profitability for banks consists of
absorbing and managing credit risk. In this, the bank seeks to earn
"the credit spread", or the premium between deposit rates and the
interest rates available when lending to firms or to individuals. In
India right now, the ballpark numbers involve borrowing at 6% and
lending at 11%, giving a handsome spread of 500 basis points.</p> 

<p>Over the last decade, banks have learned that this spread does not
come easy. Banks are extremely leveraged, and small failures by
borrowers to repay lead to big problems for banks. In India, on
average, banks have equity capital which is only 5% of assets, i.e. a
20 to 1 leverage ratio. This implies that a 100% loss on just 5% of
assets is enough to make the bank insolvent.</p>

<p>In order to earn the credit spread, banks need to establish a sound
credit process. This involves credit evaluation at the time of making
decisions to give loans, ongoing systems for monitoring credit
exposures and taking pro-active actions before a loan goes bad, and
strong systems for maximising recoveries once a loan goes NPA.</p> 

<p>A sound credit process requires good databases and models that
estimate the riskiness of various borrowers. It also requires
well-incentivised, well-motivated staff. Particularly in the area of
NPA recoveries, the sheer dynamism and motivation of the staff has an
enormous impact upon the recovery rate.</p> 

<p>If a bank is able to put together a sound credit process, then it does
indeed have a plausible business plan. However, this is a genuine
challenge. It is particularly hard for many PSU banks, which have weak
staff, weak decision processes, and a lack of tradition in exploiting data
and models. Many PSU banks suffer from political interference in
giving out bad loans and easing up on enforcement against NPAs.</p> 

<p>What is a bank to do when it understands that it does not have a
credible credit process, and probably never will? A second business
plan that can be adopted is to invest in risk free government bonds.</p> 

<p>When the yield curve has a normal upward slope, the bank focuses on
the difference between short-dated interest rates and long-dated
interest rates. If a bank is able to borrow at the short end of the
curve using demand deposits, and buy long-dated government bonds, then
it stands to earn the term spread. When the long end of the yield
curve was at 10%, and the average cost of funds at the short end was
2%, this was a handsome term spread of 800 basis points.</p>

<p>Thus, failing to have a good credit appraisal and risk monitoring
process can make purchase of government securities with high long term
rates an attractive proposition. In this situation even though a
portfolio consisting of floating rate loans would have implied much
less interest rate risk, banks choose an portfolio with a large
component of long dated fixed rate government securities. The bank may
aim to hold these securities till maturity to benefit from the higher
interest rate. If it believes, due to its past experience, or due to
the nature of its depositors that its current and saving deposits are
not likely to be withdrawn easily, or are 'core' in nature, it will
expect to earn a good net interest income without serious risk.</p> 

<p>However, this strategy may not be very profitable when the spread
between short and long rates is low. Indeed, buying long bonds would
expose the bank to interest rate risk without offsetting this risk by
higher interest income earnings. There seems to be little sense in
this strategy. </p> 

<p> But that is not always the case. The strategy of investing in long
dated government debt may still make sense and the bank may choose to
take this risk if it is expecting the yield curve to shift. In other
words, it places a bet on interest rates moving down. In the last two
years banks have made huge profits by betting on interest rates moving
down. The longer is the duration of his investment portfolio the
higher will be the profit a bank expects to make when there is a drop
in interest rates.</p>

<p>Banks are nudged along this path by poor rules on interest rate
risk regulation and lower regulatory capital requirements, which
encourage 'regulatory capital arbitrage' bearing interest rate risk
instead of credit risk.</p>

<p>Banks thus face a choice between two ways to make a living: To build a
sound credit process, or to speculate on interest rate risk. In India,
some major banks have chosen to emphasise the credit process. The two
largest banks in the system, SBI and ICICI Bank, seem to be trying
this. They do not carry much interest rate risk.</p> 

<p>Interest rates have gone down systematically in recent
years. Further, expectations of further softening have been
raised. Hence, many banks have setup their balance sheets to speculate
that interest rates will go down. This has led them to steadfastly buy
long government bonds. This may be an important reason for the unusual
flattening of the yield curve.</p>

<p>This is a paradoxical situation. A flat yield curve reduces the
profits from borrowing at the short end and buying long bonds. At the
same time, purchases by banks seeking to speculate on dropping
interest rates have been strong enough that the yield curve has been
flattened out.</p> 

<p>Hopefully, with the pick up in manufacturing, the demand for credit
will be higher. This, in addition, to flat yield curves, and reduced
expectations of further large declines in interest rates should
motivate banks to improve their credit processes, and return to the
business of giving bank credit. </p>
