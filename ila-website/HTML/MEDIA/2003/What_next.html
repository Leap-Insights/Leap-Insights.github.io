  What next on interest rates?
</h1>

<HR>

<p>Net capital inflows into India, on account of interest
differentials and an appreciating rupee, have risen in the last two
months. Investments by FIIs in the debt market, by NRIs in NRE
accounts, and offshore borrowing by firms have increased sharply in
May.</p>

<p>Today, it is possible for a foreigner to invest in an Indian
treasury bill, be fully hedged and yet earn higher than international
returns. This is possible because the forward premium on the rupee
dollar rate has dropped to historic lows. The demand for treasury
bills has put a downward pressure on yields, pushing rates below the 5
per cent repo rate. In this turn of events RBI's exchange rate policy
is clearly a major factor. This policy impacts expectations and thus
the forward premium. </p>

<p>A key facet of this situation is the new constraints that our open
capital account places upon macro policy. Countries with an open
current account face a conflict between interest rate policy and
exchange rate policy. For India, the dilemma is relatively recent. As
long as the capital account was closed, the RBI could conduct its
monetary policy and exchange rate policy independently of each
other. But since 1993, with the opening up of the economy, the two are
no longer independent.</p>

<p>The conflict between the two policies is sharpest when a country
tries to keep its exchange rate fixed. At a fixed exchange rate, net
inflows or outflows have to be absorbed by the central bank so that
they do not change the price of the domestic currency. Reserves go up
and down in response to capital flows, and thus monetary policy is
determined by the external sector.</p>

<p>While India does not have a fixed exchange rate, the exchange rate
is actively managed by the RBI. But a central bank can only
autonomously choose monetary and interest rate policy if it has no
currency policy. An independent monetary policy, a fixed exchange rate
and an open capital account have come to be known as the 'impossible
trinity' or the 'open economy trilemma'.  </p>

<p>Since few countries follow a policy of a fixed exchange rate, the
impossible trinity can be interpreted as the relationship between the
country's interest rate flexibility and exchange rate flexibility in
an open capital account. A country that seeks low volatility of the
exchange rate is likely to endup with high volatility of interest
rates, since interest rates have to move quite a bit in defence of
currency policy. Cross country data thus shows a high correlation
between low exchange rate volatility and high interest rate
volatility.</p>

<p>Until now the RBI has been wedded to reducing currency volatility,
as a policy goal. The INR-USD exchange rate appears to be a crawling
peg. The rupee is allowed to move, but only by small amounts. Sharp
movements in the rupee have, in general, been avoided. Not only has
the RBI intervened directly in foreign exchange markets, not only has
it asked SBI to buy or sell dollars on its behalf, it has also changed
interest rates, to prevent sharp volatility in the exchange rate of
the rupee. The 200 bps move in interest rates on 16 January 1998 was
such an example. </p>

<p>So while the pressure on the exchange rate in the recent two years
initially came from the current account, the policy of letting the
rupee move only by small amounts has created avenues for speculation
and today the pressure is coming in from rising capital flows. Our
currency regime has, ironically, converted a current account surplus
into a capital surge. </p>

<p>If the RBI were to continue to target currency volatility, the
impossible trinity of an open economy will not allow it to contain
volatility in interest rates as well. The logical consequence of
sustaining the existing currency policy, i.e. of trying to stem
capital inflows, would be to cut the repo rate.</p>

<p>In the current situation, continuing with its exchange rate policy,
and therefore cutting interest rates does not appear to be a very
difficult decision. Inflation rates are low and whatever inflation we
have had in the recent months has been more on account of petroleum
and edible oil prices, than excess money stock. RBI may hence find
cutting the repo rate, and sustaining the status quo on the currency
regime, to be an easy option.</p>


<p>The story may, however, not be a simple one.  An important impact
of any step taken by a central bank policy is the effect it has on
expectations. And, in India expectations about the INR/USD rate
determine the forward premium. So, while cutting interest rates may be
meant to reduce capital inflows by reducing the interest differential,
the step may not impact capital inflows to a large extent because
these also depend on rupee expectations which will not change
immediately. Cutting rates would give a signal that the RBI is wedded
to policy of low exchange rate volatility and keep the forward premium
low. With low forward premiums an investor can be fully hedged and can
choose to invest in India even when interest differentials are not
very large. </p>


<p>When does this saga end? The rupee cannot appreciate
indefinitely. When expectations change, there would be an outflow of
capital. At that point, preserving the current currency
regime would involve raising interest rates to defend the rupee, and
keep rupee volatility low.</p>

<p>So it appears that we may be headed first for lower interest rates,
and then for higher interest rates. Interest rates will have to bounce
around in sustaining the present currency regime, which targets
currency volatility.</p>


<p>It is clear that India can no longer behave as if that our capital
account is closed enough for us not to have to make a choice between
exchange rate stability and independent monetary policy. Before a
crisis arises we need to take a fresh look at the trade-offs posed by
an open capital account.
</p>


<p>What is the right choice for India? Is currency volatility harmful?
Is currency volatility more harmful than interest rate volatility? Can
we just have a currency futures market, accessible to all, so that
people can find private solutions to currency volatility?  Should
monetary policy be controlled by currency policy? Is monetary policy
useful for greater goals, like targeting prices and playing a
counter-cyclical role, or should monetary policy be 'used up' for
reducing currency volatility?  These are key economic policy questions
that need to be debated.</p>
