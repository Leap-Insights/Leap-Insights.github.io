<p> When RBI Governor Dr. Y.V. Reddy presented the mid-year review
of the monetary policy earlier this week, he noted that in the first
half of this year the rupee appreciated and that India accumulated an
additional USD 17.2 billion as reserves. However, as he left interest
rates and the CRR untouched, there is little reason to believe that
the credit policy will address the issue of capital inflows that is
fuelled by the expectations of rupee appreciation.</p>

<p>If Dr. Reddy decided not to cut interest rates, there must be a good
reason for it. But since currency expectations are clearly a problem
for him, he must have another solution in mind. Perhaps this issue
will be solved by Finance Minister Jaswant Singh.  The current
scenario provides Mr. Singh with an opportune envirnoment for cutting
custom duties. In earlier years the government might have been worried
about the impact lower duties would have on India's balance of
payments. Reduced custom tariffs would make prices of imported goods
low and increase imports. Today, if this happens, it will help put the
reserves to good use and reduce the pressure on the rupee to
appreciate. </p>

<p>India has the highest customs duties among industrializing
nations. Nearly five years ago Yashwant Sinha had
started a practice of cutting the "peak" customs tariff by 5
percentage points every year. Last year Jaswant Singh stayed with that
convention, cutting tariffs by 5 percentage points. This year, he can
make use of the "problem" of reserves by turning it into an advantage
and going faster on reducing tariffs. He has a golden opportunity to
make his mark in India's economic history by pushing down custom
tariffs to Chinese levels.</p>


<p>But, would not, as many industrialists argue, a sharp reduction in
custom duties destroy Indian industry? Fortunately, evidence suggests
otherwise. The reduction in duties along with liberalisation of
industry in the last decade gave Indian manufacturing the opportunity to
become competitive. Today corporate India stands ready to compete with the
best firms in the world. Mr. Singh will not merely be solving
the problem of rising reserves, he would be providing Indian
manufacturing a boost.</p>

<p>The days when the government of India used the worry that there is
a huge pent-up demand for imported consumer goods are over. It is no
longer a worry that a reduction in custom duties would raise consumer
demand and push India into an external crisis. Indeed, with lower
prices of capital goods and raw materials, investment would
benefit. There is no doubt that firms and industries that exist only
because they are being protected by high duty rates will suffer. But it
is ridiculous to suggest that there will be economy wide destruction
of manufacturing.</p>

<p> There is a certainty that within a few years India will get down
to Chinese levels of tariffs - i.e. an <i>average</i> tariff of
8%. There are good reasons not to create policy uncertainty by saying
this will happen and keep alive expectations of custom duty cuts. That
only makes it more difficult for investors to make projections about
the future and thus to postpone investment. </p>

<p>Ever since Yashwant Sinha embarked on this program of cutting the
peak rate, by 5 percentage points a year, this fear about the future
has inhibited manufacturing investment in India. This is not to
criticise his basic effort. The intuition about the need to get India
out of the protectionist mentality was correct. China's 8% average
tariff is an important reason why China is beating India at
manufacturing exports.</p>

<p>The only flaw in his framework was the negative impact on
investment. This can be eliminated by dropping tariffs <i>right
away</i>, and then giving firms a stable and predictable
environment. Stability and predictability are the ideal environment
for investment to take off. The objective of 8% GDP growth
will suddenly become more feasible. </p>

<p>But will not a cut in custom duties have a disastrous impact on
public finances? Custom revenues constitued 19 per cent of gross tax
revenue last year. If duties are brought down drastically, would there
not be a sharp reduction in custom revenues collected and thus an
increase in the fiscal deficit? </p>

<p>No. First, cutting tariffs will tend to raise imports (through
cheaper imported goods) and depreciate the rupee. Both these factors
serve to increase the <i>rupee</i> value of imports, which is the tax
base. Both these factors would offset some of the impact of the tariff
cut.</p>

<p>Also, reducing tariffs will boost exports. Therefore, along with
cutting custom tariffs, export subsidies should be removed at the same
time.  This will again offset some more of the lost revenue.</p>

<p>Finally, cutting tariffs to 8% will ignite a new phase of growth in
manufacturing, investment and GDP growth. This will feed into buoyancy
of excise and income tax, thus offsetting the impact on customs
revenues.</p>


<p> Industrialists often say that they need tariffs to `protect' them, as
long as India has problems such as labour law or bad airports or
incompetent railways. However, production is a complex process which
requires numerous inputs. The costs of labour, electricity, ports,
steel, etc. are all factors that affect the profitability of an
automobile component company. At any venue in the world, certain
inputs will be costly and certain inputs will be cheap.</p>

<p>Every electronics producer in Taiwan suffers from very high wage
costs. Every Indian factory benefits from being able to pay some of
the lowest wages in the world. This benefit is offset by higher costs
in certain areas, like electricity or road transportation. The
Taiwanese electronics company does not complain that he needs tariffs
because one of his inputs (labour) is expensive.</p>

<p>It would make a lot of sense for exporters, who generally lobby
simply for rupee depreciation, to instead lobby for cutting customs
duties. Not only would they be able to avail of cheaper inputs, higher
imports would create a market pressure for a weaker rupee.</p>

<p> Unfortunately industry associations, who could have in principle,
played a useful role if they put pressure on the government to cut
customs, themselves represent various hetrogenous interests. Since
some of these interests are served by protectionist policies, it is
politically convenient to 'demand' rupee depreciation. It must be
quite clear to industry groups and exporters today that to engineer a
depreciation of the rupee vs the US dollar is not an easy task. </p>

<p>Dollar demand will be increased by higher imports. Cutting tariffs
will not only solve Dr. Reddy's problems on the rupee, but also Mr.
Jaswant Singh's problem of low investment demand and low demand for
credit.  Since consumers all over the country, who are far more
numerous than a handful of industrialists, will benefit from lower
prices, Mr. Singh will also, no doubt, also benefit from their goodwill
in the coming elections. </p>
