  The visible hand

<p>Strong ideological divisions have often prevented honest and useful
discussions on many aspects of public policy. One such example in
India has been labour markets. Labour employed in the organised sector
have prevented making the labour market flexible by opposing policy
changes that would make it easier to sack workers.  India's labour
force, 400 million strong, stands to gain if labour mobility
increases. But the 30 million in the organised sector may stand to
lose from a more flexible labour market. Yet, a position that argues
in favour of an exit policy for industry and a change in labour laws
is viewed as anti-labour.</p>

<p>In the same vein, to point out that capitalism and free-markets
have often been abused by capitalists themselves is, in an
ideologically divided world, perceived to be anti-capitalism. While a
large number of 'free market' economists would be happy to talk about
how UN-free labour markets support incumbents in the labour market, few
seek to analyse how financial markets that are not free support the
rich and powerful in these markets. Such arguments are often viewed as
a critique of free markets. To ask for active government interference
in markets, in order to make markets work, is viewed as
contradictory. </p>

<p>Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales have successfully crossed this
line in a recent book called <i>Saving Capitalism from the
Capitalists.</i> They argue that markets need rules to function and
flourish. The absence of rules on the one hand, or rules that stifle
competition on the other, lead to opportunities for misuse of
markets. In many countries, dominant business elites have created
rules that prevent markets from becoming truly free. India's recent
experience in telecom policy, where big business houses have competed
to influence policy, is an example of these concerns.</p>

<p>The free market is a powerful tool for obtaining efficiency and a
meritocracy. But by creating competition, free markets undermine the
power of those capitalists who are already present in the market.</p>

<p>Free markets are often understood to be markets that are left free
to operate without interference from the government. But is a market
that is open only to those who are already present in it, and which
prevents access to those outside it, truly free and competitive?
There is, argue Rajan and Zingales, a role for a government to
carefully examine closed clubs, and undertake actions to force club
markets to open up to wider participation and competition. The authors
ask how government can be made to set rules in the interests of the
people.</p>

<p>India's story on the equity market is a striking illustration of
this problem. The equity market was once run by a club in south
Bombay, the Bombay Stock Exchange. The BSE controlled access to club
membership, and the BSE made the rules about how trading took
place. This was not an open, competitive market. A simplistic `free
market economics' view on policy would have argued that the BSE is a
private club and should be left alone to run the equity market.</p>

<p>In retrospect, SEBI and the Ministry of Finance very wisely chose
not to leave the BSE to its own devices. They pushed for a highly
unusual idea, that of a quasi public-sector stock exchange, the
National Stock Exchange. This led to a revolution in India's equity
market. It has given a transparent and open market, with participation
from across the country. It has modernised technology, and eliminated
the rents of club members.</p>

<p>A similar story is faced on India's debt market also. The debt
market is a cosy club which runs on telephone calls in south
Bombay. The open question for policy is how we can move away from this
club into an open, transparent market with wide participation by other
economic agents, from all over India. A simplistic policy position
which advocates leaving this market to incumbent club members would
not give us the benefits of a genuine market.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the market works in public interest, it can lead to a
better distribution of wealth, one that is not concentrated with a few
established families.  Most economists have argued that free markets
lead to more efficiency and higher growth. But few have focused on
how free markets help in obtaining better distribution. Indeed, since
markets are governed by rules made by the rich and politically
powerful, they are often seen as instruments to make the rich
richer.</p>

<p>However, argue Rajan and Zingales, free markets, particularly well
developed financial markets have not just created wealth but also
distributed it better. Markets expand opportunities for those
individuals and firms who are not part of the established
wealthy. Countries with better developed financial systems have a
higher frequency of self-made billionaires per million inhabitants! An
increase in the size of the equity market in France (50 per cent of
GDP in 1996) to the level in the US (140 per cent of GDP) would be
associated with an increase in the frequency of self-made billionaires
in France from 0.07 per million to approximately 0.30. The difference
between America's 0.28 billionaire per million and France's number of
billionaires is entirely explained by the difference in the openness
of finance.</p>

<p>However, the authors argue that economic institutions neither arise
nor flourish if there is no political will to back them. In terms of
political economy, it was unusual for SEBI and the MoF to make war
with BSE members; it will be difficult for RBI and MoF to take on
existing club members in the debt market. There is thus a need to
create conditions such that the the incentive to oppose change is
reduced. The objective is to ensure that incumbents have largely the
same interests as everyone else.</p>

<p>Since inefficient owners tend to oppose rules that promote
competition, the authors propose policies that would promote
productive assets going into efficient hands. This can be done by
changing the structure of taxes, opening up borders to increase
competition for domestic producers and creating safety nets for
individuals rather than firms. Most importantly the force of awareness
is one of the strongest forces in a democracy. A better awareness and
understanding of how governments can help support public interest as
opposed to private interests by better rules and regulation can create
a strong force to support change. </p>

<p>Economists believe that free markets are great, but government
sometimes needs to intervene to make markets free. Withdrawal of the
government from the market can sometimes only help the privileged
few. The middle ground between an absence of rules and the presence of
suffocating rules is narrow and delicate. If the public is aware of
its interests, then democratic forces can make it happen.</p>
