<h1>Quasi-fiscal costs</h1>
<p><i><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/quasi-fiscal-costs-103091701102_1.html" style="text-decorating:none" >Business Standard</a></i>, 17 September 2003</p>

<p>Last week the RBI added USD 1.1 billion to foreign exchange
reserves. There are reports that schemes are being formulated to
encourage the Resurgent India Bond (RIB) funds to stay with
India. Finance minster Jaswant Singh has said that India will hold USD
100 billion in reserves by the end of the year.</p>

<p>There may or may not be merit in holding extremely large
reserves. This article is about one element of the <i>cost</i> of
building these reserves. Clarity on the costs will help us think more
clearly about the choices involved. Though the RBI mentions that the
policy has costs in the latest Annual Report, no attempt is made to
measure them. In a recent paper <i>The costs of currency intervention
in India</i> (see http://openlib.org/home/ila/currency.html), I
explore some of these issues.</p>

<p>We begin with a look at RBI's earnings for the year 2002-03.</p> 

<p>The RBI has reported that for the year 2002-03 the surplus it
transfered to the Government of India was Rs.8,834 crore. This was
lower than the sum of Rs.10,324 crore transfered in 2001-02. A lower
transfer from RBI to GOI resulted in an addition to the fiscal deficit
of the center. This reduction in income took place even though RBI's
total assets (domestic plus foreign) increased. So what caused this
fall in income?</p> 

<p>Since an addition to foreign exchange reserves has an impact on the
monetary base, the RBI sterilised its purchase of dollars by reducing
its domestic assets through open market operations of marketable
government securities. Foreign currency assets of the RBI increased
from Rs.2.67 lakh crore on June 30, 2002 to Rs.3.65 lakh crore on
June 30, 2003. Domestic assets fell from Rs.1.86 lakh crore to
Rs.1.54 lakh crore. Gross interest income fell from approximately
Rs.25,478 crore to Rs.22,890 crore.</p>

<p>This reduction in gross interest income by Rs. 2,580 crore
contributed to the reduction in the surplus transfered to the
government. This was partly the result of lower foreign and domestic
interest rates.  It was also the result of the policy of sterilised
intervention by the RBI and is popularly known in the literature as
quasi-fiscal costs. The concept can be found in a 1991 IMF Staff Paper
by Guillermo Calvo titled "The perils of sterilisation". `Quasi-fiscal
costs' ensue when central banks exchange high-yielding domestic
government debt for foreign securities typically paying lower nominal
yields when they undertake sterilised intervention. The term
'quasi-fiscal' indicates that the accounts of parastatal enterprises
such as the central bank are included. </p>

<p>When GOI issues a bond that RBI buys, the consolidated balance
sheet of GOI plus RBI is unaffected. It is only when the RBI sells
that government bond, that the consolidated balance sheet of the
government and RBI now shows a liability and involves an interest
outgo.</p>

<p>India is not the first country to witness such costs. Surges in
capital inflows in a number of countries, such as those in the Pacific
Basin in the 1980s and early 1990s, led to concerns about the
implications of capital inflows for the exchange rate. If the exchange
rate was floating, these inflows could lead to an appreciation of the
currency, and loss of competitiveness. Many central banks resorted to
sterilised intervention, in order to try to have a currency policy
without simultaneously subordinating monetary policy. Studies indicate
that these costs may be 0.25 to 0.5 per cent of GDP. During periods of
surges in capital inflows quasi-fiscal costs have been seen to rise up
to over one percent of GDP.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that researchers find that if
quasi-fiscal costs represent a significant cost to government, it may
play a role in the timing of the abandonment of a sterilisation
program.  Since the sterilisation program represents an effort to
maintain a downward peg on a nominal exchange rate while maintaining a
monetary policy objective, a government that decides that these costs
have become too high will rationally choose to abandon such a program,
either by allowing its exchange rate to appreciate or its money supply
to rise.</p>

<p>The response to rising quasi-fiscal costs has varied across
countries.  Ken Kletzer and Mark Spiegel find that in response to
rising QFC, Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan reduced the extent of
sterilisation.  While the increase in domestic credit was still
contained, it no longer fully offset the impact of capital inflows.
Other countries, such as Indonesia, Korea and Singapore maintained
their sterilisation programs in the face of quasi-fiscal cost surges.
In these countries domestic credit growth did not expand.</p>

<p>Another response to rising QFC has been to give up the
erstwhile currency policy. In Singapore, after the sudden rise in
inflows, the central bank reduced its intervention in the forex
market. Consequently, the nominal and real exchange rate appreciated
significantly. Similarly, Chile and Spain widened their exchange rate
band and allowed some appreciation.</p> 

<p>In India, quasi-fiscal costs were about 0.56 percent of GDP in both
2001-02 and 2002-03. If reserves were to rise to USD 100 billion next
year, quasi-fiscal costs could rise to 0.67 per cent of GDP or roughly 11
per cent of the interest expenses of GOI.</p>

<p>If USD 25 billion are added to reserves in 2003-04, then with an
average interest differential over the year of 4 percent, there will
be an additional cost of Rs.4,500 crore to the RBI.</p>

<p>It is another matter that the RBI does not hold enough government
securities to sterilise USD 25 billion to its reserves, if it chooses
to add them. During 2002-03, to ensure that the RBI has a sufficient
stock of marketable securities, the GOI converted large amounts of
Special Securities issued earlier to RBI into marketable securities.</p> 

<p>The RBI has set up a working group to look into the issue of RBI
bonds that can be used to sterilise the monetary impact of reserve
accumulation. Currently this is prohibited by RBI Act, 1935. Even if the
Act is amended and RBI is allowed to issue bonds against its dollar
reserves, the interest it would pay is likely to be higher than what
it receives on US T-bills and the quasi-fiscal costs would not
be reduced. </p>

<p>If there was fiscal transparency in the Indian system and next year's
budget earmarked a sum of Rs.4,500 crore of taxpayers money for adding
USD 25 billion to reserves, the government would have to clearly
indicate the benefits from this additional accumulation. However, as
it is in the case of defence expenditure, the government can impose
these costs on the public and get away by appealing to nationalist
sentiments. </p>
