<h1> Outlook for credit policy </h1>
<hr>
<p>Y. V. Reddy's first credit policy will be subject to much scrutiny,
even though he has, doubtless, written a few of these before. What are the
issues and priorities which should figure in the upcoming policy?</p>

<p>The first issue of concern is the interest rate environment. The
most important challenge is that of dealing with capital inflows.
Under the terms of RBI's existing peg to the US dollar, RBI has
steadily purchased foreign currency in recent years. Normally, this
would lead to an increase in money supply. From July 2002 onwards, RBI
has engaged in sterilised intervention, thus offsetting this impact of
rising reserves on domestic money supply. This appears to have been
been a striking success, and today the RBI might feel that it can
freely engage in currency intervention, but still suffer no
consequences.</p>

<p>However, sterilisation is at best a limited tool, and its problems
are now increasingly visible. The most important logical problem is
that sterilisation tends to elevate local interest rates and invites
further capital inflows. The sustainable path consists of a reduction
in capital flows. If RBI is to stick to its currency policy, then this
involves subjugating interest rate policy. In other words, it means
cutting interest rates, in order to slow down capital inflows.&nbsp;
As most currency speculation is focused on short term interest rates,
it is the bank rate and the repo rate that need to be addressed. While
the repo rate was cut by 50 bps, the inflow continues, suggesting that
there needs to be a further cut. Also, the bank rate, which
also has a signalling value for bank lending rates, needs to be cut.</p>

<p>One impediment to the adjustment of interest rates is the savings
deposit rate. In a liberalised economy, there is no case for RBI to be
setting this rate. The argument is sometimes made that such a
rate cut would adversely affect `the middle class'. However, it is hard
to argue that the `middle class' obtains a significant part of its
income from funds held in savings bank accounts.</p>

<p>A grave danger in dealing with the present problems, of the currency
regime, is that of engaging in policies which are a throwback to the
1970s. RBI has a long tradition of implementing goals of monetary
policy using a large number of administrative levers. In the current
liberal environment there should not be a move back to administrative
controls.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, RBI has given instructions to banks about what
interest rates they can offer on NRE deposits. Proposals for raising
the ECB ceiling of $1.5 billion have been blocked. Imposing controls
on one route can only encourage other, often illegal, routes for
capital movements. </p>

<p>This links up to the recent debate about benchmark PLR. The interest
rate that a bank charges its borrower is something that should be
settled between the borrower and the bank considering various factors.
When a person takes a car loan, there is a very transparent indicator
of the price, which is the EMI. It is easy to shop around and choose
the bank with the lowest EMI. There is no role for RBI to get involved
in defining the benchmark rate with respect to which credit takes place.</p>

<p>There have been concern about low offtake of bank credit. The
steepening of the yield curve, through a lowering of the repo rate and
the bank rate, would also address this issue. The weak demand for
short term corporate credit is due to a combination of several
factors. It is partly driven by offshore borrowing and trade
credit. It is also driven by efficiency gains. In the 4000
manufacturing firms found in the CMIE Prowess database, working
capital as a fraction of sales has dropped from 13% to 3% over a five
year period. On a base of Rs.9,00,000 crore of sales that these firms
have, this improvement in efficiency has dropped demand for working
capital by a substantial amount of roughly Rs.90,000 crore.</p>

<p>Bankers may bemoan this efficiency gain of the corporate sector. But
it is not something absolute. It is important to also interpret demand
for working capital as a <i>price</i> phenomenon. Current market
conditions imply that at existing prices which banks like to charge
corporate customers, the corporate sector is not keen on drawing upon
bank credit. A steepening of the yield curve, with lower interest rates
at the short end, would help obtain an equilibrium between deposits and
offtake at the short end.</p>

<p>Banks also need to be better prepared for sudden changes in the
interest rate environment. One important issue that Dr. Reddy needs to
tackle is the long-standing problem of interest rate risk of Indian
banks. RBI's existing "investment fluctuation reserve" (IFR) has many
conceptual mistakes. IFR defines capital requirements for banks in
terms of <i>holdings</i> of government bonds. It ignores the extent to
which different banks are hedged on the liabilities side. It penalises
well run banks, like SBI and ICICI Bank, who have done a good job of
their ALM. In addition, IFR defines capital requirements that should
be met over years, and is silent about the consequences of interest
rate volatility <i>today</i>.</p>

<p>The most important tool for assessing the interest rate risk of
banks consists of simulating realistic shocks to the yield curve on both
assets and liabilities. RBI regulations should require that banks
engage in these calculations, and fully disclose these calculations to
the market. This would assist price discovery on the stock market, and
improve market discipline. RBI regulations should also require banks to
hold equity capital when <i>these</i> calculations reveal vulnerability
to interest rate risk (as opposed to IFR, which is blind to the risk
management of the bank).</p>

<p>The interest rate futures market is a vital element for interest
rate risk management. RBI's existing rules about interest rate futures
are riddled with mistakes.</p>

<p>First, the existing rules say that only the interest rate risk of the
government securities portfolio of a bank can be hedged using the
interest rate futures. This needs to be amended, so that the overall
interest rate risk of the <i>bank</i> can be hedged.</p>

<p>Second, the rules allow banks only to sell interest rate futures,
based on the assumption that all banks will only lose money when
interest rates go up. In fact, many banks are hedged, or have reverse
exposures. Banks can be active participants in the interest rate
futures market, through trading and arbitrage activities. By forcing
all banks to only sell interest rate futures, RBI has effectively
strangled the market.</p>

<p>RBI's rules for exchange-traded interest rate futures are a sharp
contrast with RBI's rules for the non-transparent OTC market, where RBI
allows all sorts of activities. From an economic perspective, the
opposite should be the case, where a more transparent market should
enjoy a more liberal ruleset.</p>

<p>The market will, undoubtedly, look expectantly towards Dr Reddy's
credit policy. Hopefully, it will address not just the above, but many
more issues. </p>
