  What next at RBI?
</h1>

<HR>

<p>Dear Dr. Reddy,</p>

<p>You are coming back into RBI at a critical juncture. In the last
ten years, there has perhaps not been a more interesting and
challenging time for India's monetary and exchange rate policies.</p>

<p>The crawling peg currency regime, which appears to have served
India well in the post 1998 period, is now coming under severe
stress. High levels of capital inflows arising from interest
differentials and currency expectations are a new phenomenon for
India. To manage these inflows you will need to focus on expectations
of market participants, something India does not have much experience
in. </p>

<p>The most important danger in this situation is to fall back on
controls. India's policy makers have a long experience of `solving'
problems by tweaking administrative controls or creating new
restrictions. A great deal of the staff of the government of India
instinctively responds using such an obsolete intellectual
superstructure.</p>

<p>In the last few years India has been able to achieve high growth
because of the move away from the regime of administrative
controls. Governer Jalan's greatest achievement has been a substantial
easing of currency controls. </p>

<p>Time has perhaps dulled our memories of the horrors of currency
controls. The distortions they introduce, the behaviours they reward,
are far reaching. In our FERA world, we criminalised ordinary
transactions, hobbled the trade and capital integration of India with
the world, and created a Kafkaesque policing structure. We must
resolutely turn away from that option.</p>

<p>It is true that the current situation is new for us. But we need
new tools to respond to it and not fall back upon tried and
failed ones. We have no option but to truly understand open economy
macroeconomics and to confront basic questions about the currency
regime and macroeconomic and monetary policy.</p>

<p>Let me paint a couple of scenarios which you should envision, and plan
for.</p>

<p>We can visualise a 'good' scenario. The rupee continues to
appreciate and capital continues to flow in. In this scenario we
witness no external shocks. In the last 12-18 months, our crawling peg
regime has converted a current account problem into a capital account
problem. RBI prevents the rupee from sharply appreciating on any one
day. So speculators know that the rupee will appreciate in the
future. Every time speculators sell $1 billion to RBI at Rs.46 and
take it back at Rs.45, RBI loses Rs.100 crore.</p>

<p>However, India is unable to absorb the capital flowing into the
country. The outcome of the current regime violates the purpose of
management of the exchange rate - to be able to allow India to invest
more than it saves. To do that India needs to run a current account
deficit. The objective of having an open capital account for a capital
scarce, developing country is to be able to import capital such that
domestic investment exceeds domestic saving. The route to higher
investment is when interest rates fall with the inflow of
capital. That allows the capital inflow to be absorbed by investment
increasing and growth rising. If instead of a current account surplus
of 1.5 per cent of GDP, India ran a current account deficit of 2.5 per
cent of GDP, we would be investing 4 per cent more of GDP. This would
significantly push up the growth rate. </p>

<p> A 'bad' scenario is one where there is an exogenous shock. Most
crisis arise not by slowly and steadily walking into them, but by
allowing conditions to arise where we are hit by unexpected shocks. A
sharp change in conditions, for example, in international bond markets
that push up interest rates in the US, could well create conditions
for capital to flow out of India. </p>

<p>This could create turmoil in the market. It is difficult to say
where the rupee would be in such an event. It is difficult to imagine
a smooth transition to equilibrium. No doubt the market would see some
overshooting and some intervention. The real implications of this will
be painful. Many firms and banks in India will face difficulties owing
to unhedged currency exposures. </p>

<p>It appears reasonable to think that you will use RBI's large kitty of
forex reserves in coping with the exit of the hot money. You could
easily use up $30 billion in defending the rupee.  However, if
you are also tempted to use interest rates to push up the rupee, it
could expose a large number of businesses and households to high
risks. The decline in interest rates over the last few years have
seduced many borrowers to borrow at floating rates. When these rise,
many could be pushed into bankruptcy. </p>


<p>However, even if there are no such nasty shocks to the system, and
the present situation of high capital inflows continues, it is not
something that is desirable. There is a need to think about how to
solve the problem. The problem of high inflows that is not just
arising out of disequilibrium in the market, but causing further
movement towards greater disequilibrium. </p>

<p>Since the short term capital inflows are caused mainly by two
factors: the interest differential and the expectation of
appreciation, there is a need to address both these. Last week the RBI
imposed an upper limit on NRI deposit rates. This step and the recent
widening of the band in which the rupee moves on are indications that
the RBI is trying to find a solution. However, moving towards
administrative controls on interest rates should not be the default
mode. </p>


<p>With $84 billion in your pocket, Dr. Reddy, you may consider this
an appropriate time to make a soft landing to a new currency
regime. RBI needs to shift to a floating exchange rate, so that
the INR/USD exchange rate becomes a random walk and there are
no unidirectional currency expectations. While hot money may leave the
country, it is likely to happen more slowly than may happen if, under
the current expecations of rupee appreciation, there is a sudden
shock. </p>

<p>The conventional wisdom internationally has increasingly
shifted in favour of a floating exchange rate, where the central bank
seldom engages in currency intervention. As recent events have
demonstrated, it is difficult to engage in currency policy once the
capital account is sufficiently open. Monetary policy is something too
precious to give up, in trying to achieve a tightly controlled
exchange rate.</p>

<p>Today, you are well placed to handle a slowdown of inflows. You are
well placed to handle a pressure on the rupee to weaken. It makes so
much more sense to move before there is a crisis. No, doubt there will
be difficulties but India is today ready for a change in currency
regime. The next few months will hopefully see you head that change. </p>
