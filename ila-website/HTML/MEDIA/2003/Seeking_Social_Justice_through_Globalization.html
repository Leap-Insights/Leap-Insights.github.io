<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Globalization,
from a “leftist” perspective, is often interpreted as a phenomenon that
increases the economic, cultural and political powers of rich Western
nations. Kitching assesses the various dimensions of globalization -
production, trade, labour migration, finance and communications to
argue that globalization is a phenomenon that can work towards
alleviating the poverty of the poorest peoples and nations in the
world.&nbsp; With the free movement of labour and capital, which today
does not take place, globalization of production based on comparative
advantage could increase production for all. Instead of thinking of
total production in the world as given and thus winning and losing as a
zero-sum game, it could increase the size of the pie and hence
everybody's share of the pie. </span></font></p>
<font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">While MNCs
figure predominantly in the debate on globalization, the author argues
that it is really globalized economic activity in which hundreds and
thousands of little firms participate that forms the basis of today's
global trade and production. MNCs may actually even be better employers
than most of these small firms because they can pay higher wages in
poor countries which are much higher than in rich countries but still
higher than what the local firms pay their workers. </span></font></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Similarly,
today globalized financial markets are not the result of a few
speculators who wish to make profits. Though it is George Soros or LTCM
that get notorious for speculating in global financial markets, and
putting the entire financial system of many a nations at risk, it is
“sweet old Mr and Mrs Brown” whose pension fund was invested heavily in
Asian stock markets in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When this
pension fund and others like it abandoned these markets in the Asian
crisis, they caused a run and pushed many countries over the brink of
disaster. Among today's biggest investors are the old and retired who
look for the best returns for their life-time savings. Their pension
and insurance funds hunt markets all over the world for the highest
earnings. Reduction of capital controls as well as the development of
telecommunications that has greatly speeded up the process of
transacting in these economies has helped the financial system across
the globe to become one big whole. Further, it is the slowdown in
growth in the developed countries and the relatively higher growth in
emerging economies that make the investors look for investment
opportunities abroad.</span></font></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Bipolar
theories in which all winners (or losers) were in one part of the globe
are, according to the author, no longer adequate to describe and
explain a world that has, in the last 30 years, become far more
complex. It now makes far more sense to analyse inequalities in India
in the same class framework as in the US. Such changes in the real
world have led to changes in language from the use of the term
“imperialism” to globalisation because it is a single system
(capitalism) globalising itself rapidly. </span></font></p>
<font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">One of
Ketching's main arguments is that the process of globalisation and
judgement on whether it is desirable or not is affected, explicitly or
implicitly, by nationalist feelings. He asks whether when addressing
issues such as the welfare of workers, employment, economy and poverty,
the left intellectual in a rich country understands these terms with a
particular nationalist prefix or on a global level. </span></font></p>
<font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Kitching
questions the “left” or “starving babies” conception of
underdevelopment. Despite their insights and understanding of western
societies as divided along class lines, these intellectuals almost
forget class divisions in poor, developing countries. As a result they
tend to treat poor nations as if they were classless, and ignore the
class structures and the shifting dynamics of that structure. They are
apt to treat non-European societies as if they were somehow less
socially and ideologically complex than their own and somehow
“primitive”. </span></font></p>
<font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">A large body
of literature on poverty in the world and estimates across the world
examines GDP growth and per capita GDP trends but often tends to ignore
the social economic or class-inequality dimension. Western authors are
often embarrassed by, and therefore unwilling to draw attention to,
these class differences which are often much sharper than in the rich
countries. His criticism, seems somewhat sweeping, because even though
a large body of literature that does not address class issues may
exist, which the author attributes to what he calls the “intellectual
left”, and does not address issues of peasantry, of class, religious,
ethnic and gender relations in poor countries, there does exist, albeit
small, serious and in depth work by good scholars on these issues. What
the author's seems to include in the “left” is indeed quite different
from the concept of “left” in the developing world, which tends to be
more Marxist. It is a modern western concept that appears to include
the UNDP, the World Bank and the UNCTAD, agencies that the average
Indian would hardly consider leftist. </span></font></p>
<font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The book
offers interesting new angles to old issues. However, the author's
solution that if some people decide to commit themselves - both
intellectually and in political action - to principles that involve
thinking globally, the poverty in poor countries could be sharply
reduced, appears to be naïve and too simple. Political support is
unlikely to be available to such groups that are not backed by direct
beneficiaries, except, as the author argues, the poorest in the world,
who too would benefit in a time horizon of around 30 years. </span></font></p>
<font size="+3"> </font><font size="+3"> </font>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><font size="+3"><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The arguments
in favour of a Ricardian world, with nations producing according to
their comparative advantage, found in text-books on trade theory, are
simple and convincing. However, efficiency gains in a Ricardian model,
a model that assumes constant returns to scale and perfect competition,
occur only in the simplest case. Increasing returns to scale and
imperfect competition violate these conditions. There exist strongly
entrenched vested interests in various parts of the world, such as
labour in the rich countries who stand to lose, and capitalists in poor
countries who would be the losers in a global economy with the free
movement of labour and capital. The political economy of the move to
such a world involves a lot more than simple intellectual commitment by
a few people. While one often finds solutions devoid of a political
economy context in economics text-books, such omissions from a
political scientist appear quite surprising. </span></font></p>
