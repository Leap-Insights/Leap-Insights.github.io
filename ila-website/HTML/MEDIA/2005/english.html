<HR>

<p>English language is being spread in India by the world
of work. And, most interstingly, young India is gearing up to meet the
challenge of English. An analysis by the Indian Express of the Indian
Retirement Earnings and Savings (IRES) shows that nearly 40 percent of the
young earners -- in the age group 20 to 30-- have at least a
rudimentary ability to read English.</p>

<p>q: How widespread is the use of English in India?</p>

<p>a: About 35 percent of the earners of India claim that they can "read"
  English. A note of caution must be added: all measurement of
  literacy is weak. A man who "claims to read English" can probably
  slowly read one letter at a time.</p>

<p>q: How do we know about this data?</p>

<p>a: One good source of knowing about this is the Indian Retirement
  Earnings and Savings (IRES) database, released by the Ministry of
  Finance and ADB. This tells us about a randomly chosen set of
  41,000 earners in the country. The focus is on earners - people who
  do not work for an income are not counted. There are 364 million
  earners, so each 1% of the earners is 3.64 million people.</p>

<p>q: What does IRES tell us about Hindi and English?</p>

<p>a: It shows a fascinating pattern:</p>

<table cellspacing="15">

<tr>
<td>  </td>
<td align="center">Speak Hindi  </td> 
<td align="center">Read Hindi  </td>
<td align="center">Speak English  </td>
<td align="center">Read English  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Yes</td>
<td align="center">69</td>
<td align="center">51.5</td>
<td align="center">16.5</td>
<td align="center">35</td
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">No</td>
<td align="center">31</td>
<td align="center">48.5</td>
<td align="center">83.5</td>
<td align="center">65</td>

</table>

  <p>In the case of Hindi, more people say they can speak but not read -
  this probably reflects a great prevalence of Bollywood-quality
  Hindi. In the case of English, it is upside down: Only 16.5% people
  are confident enough to speak, but 35% can read - this probably
  reflects English picked up at school and college. These are big
  numbers -- one-third of the 364 million earners of India is 120
  million.</p>


<p>q: What is the situation on literacy, in any language?</p>

<p>a: If we look for people who can read in either a local language,
  Hindi or English, we find that 76.5% of the earners of India are
  literate.</p>


<p>q: How does reading English or Hindi vary by age?</p>

<p>a: If we look at age 50-60, where 12% of the earners are to be found,
  roughly half of them can read Hindi but only one-third can read
  English.</p>

  <p>Young people are more likely to know English. In the 20-30 age
  group, where a quarter of India's earners are found, those who can
  read English are 10% out of 25%. Hindi readers are a bit bigger at
  14%. So English is more prevalent in the 20-30 cohort as compared
  with the 50-60 cohort.</p>


<p>q: How does reading English or Hindi vary by income class?</p>

<p>a: A rough definition that might be useful is to break India into
  three groups: "Poor", "Middle Class" and "Upper class". We classify
  the bottom 15% as poor - these prove to earn below Rs.14,000 a
  year. We classify the top 15% as rich - these prove to earn above
  Rs.85,000 a year. The in-between, the 70% of individuals earning
  between Rs.14,000 a year and Rs.85,000 a year, we classify as
  "Middle Class".</p>

  <p>The picture that we get for Hindi and English, broken-down by class:</p>

<table cellspacing="15">

<tr>
<td>  </td>
<td align="center">Poor  </td> 
<td align="center">Middle Class  </td>
<td align="center">Upper  </td>
<td align="center">Total  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Read Hindi</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">37</td>
<td align="center">11</td>
<td align="center">51.5</td
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Read English</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">23</td>
<td align="center">10</td>
<td align="center">35.0</td>

</table>
                  
  <p>This shows that out of the 15% of the upper class, 11 read Hindi
  and 10 read English. Similarly, out of the 15% of the poor, 8 read
  Hindi and 2% read English. Roughly speaking, we may say that
  English and Hindi are neck to neck when it comes to the upper
  class. Each language is known to roughly two-thirds of this group.</p>
