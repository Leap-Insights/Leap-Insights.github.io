   Dangers -- Bharat Nirman 
</h1>

<HR>

<p>Bharat Nirman has lofty goals, and public infrastructure in rural
areas is, of course, a noble cause. Under the Bharat Nirman project
the UPA government will spend Rs 174,000 crore over the next four
years for roads, irrigation, telcom, housing, drinking water and
electrification for rural India. Since private money is not
forthcoming for infrastructure projects in rural areas, there is no
option, but for the government to spend. But will the Bharat Nirman
Project be able to improve rural India's bijli, pani and sadak?</p>

<p>The UPA is hoping to replicate the success of the NDA's flagship
scheme of building national highways. The first question to ask is
would the NHDP (National Highway Development Project) have happened if
the NHAI (National Highway Authority of India) had not been created
and existed solely and exclusively to implement the NHDP?  Maybe, but
it would, most probably, have taken much longer, it would have been
costlier in the process, and the end-product might have been inferior.</p>

<p>In contrast to the NHDP, the implementation of Bharat Nirman will be
spread across hundreds of government departments across the
country. The track record of state public works departments suggests
that there is reason to worry.  Projects could get delayed, the
quality could be substandard, and yet, no one will be held
accountable. </p>

<p>Morevoer, the NHAI was not only a dedicated arm of the government,
created to complete a defined activity in a defined period of time, it
also created new mechanisms and designs for implementation of the
programme. Road design documents for each strech of 100 to 200 kms
were created with the help of international consultants to help ensure
quality, as well as prevent political interference. At later stages of
the work, monitoring was done not just by the NHAI staff, but also by
these consultants. The result that is being seen is not merely the
consequence of spending big money on roads. It is the result of the
institutional innovations that were made.</p>

<p>Second, is it not enough to build roads without creating the
institutional framework that will ensure that the roads will be
maintained. Government departments have constructed roads for 50
years. The poor maintainence of these roads is in sharp contrast to
the maintainence of the NHDP roads. </p>

<p>The question of institutional changes arises equally for the other
programmes being proposed. If spending money to lay pipes was the
answer to India's woes of inadequate drinking water, India would have
had at least good urban drinking water supply. However, this is not
the case. The problem is not the money, but the institutional
framework that offers no incentives for maintaining the pipes,
ensuring that the pipes don't leak, and that it does not mix with
sewage. Rural India does not have the economies of scale required to
run drinking water plants in each village. Moreover, it does not have
the technical expertise and engineering capacity locally available to
maintain such systems even if they are put in place.</p>

<p>What is needed is not more money for laying pipes. It has been done
for decades, and yet, in most of the country, for most of the time,
most pipes run dry. What is needed, instead, are systems which
work. So, for example, in the case of water, it has been proposed that
the government should first focus on creating well functioning urban
drinking water system, where there are both economies of scale and the
technical expertise. Once this is done, the water board of each town
should be made in charge of the drinking water supply to the
surrounding rural areas. This could be one solution, there could be
many others, differing from district to district. We do not know what
will work. But we do know what will not work.</p>
