<h1>New Fed on the block</h1>

<p><i>Ben Bernanke has been named successor to Alan Greenspan, the
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of the US. It is expected that he
will favour "rules to discretion" in running America's (and through it
a large part of the world's) monetary policy. What does this mean for
India?</i></p>

<p><b> What is meant by "rules rather than discretion"?</b></p>

<p>Economists now believe that if a central bank has "discretion", i.e
   it chooses its next step based not on clear objectives and clearly
   defined methods to achieve those objectives, but on some notions
   that it holds close to its heart, this will lead to inferior
   economic outcomes. Everybody is better off if the central bank
   binds it's own hands by working within rules.</p>

<p><b> What kinds of rules can be written? </b></p>

<p>The most important rule for a central bank, which has gained ground
   worldwide, is called "inflation targeting". In this, the central
   bank commits itself to a numerical target for inflation in the long
   run. This is generally accompanied by a tremendous transparency in
   how monetary policy is conducted. </p>


<p><b> Why do central banks need to be transparent?</b></p>

<p>The most important way in which monetary policy operates, in the
   modern world, with well developed financial markets, is by shaping
   the expectations of financial players. If a central bank lies or
   speaks in mumbo jumbo, then participants in financial markets do
   not know what is coming next. The Bank of England is seen as
   a role model in how this should be organised.</p> 

<p><b>How does the Bank of England work?</b></p>

<p>The UK ministry of finance writes a letter to the Bank of England
   telling them what inflation rate should be targeted. The typical
   value has been 2%.</p>

<p>The Bank of England has a monetary policy committee, which includes
   outsiders. They periodically vote on whether rates should be raised
   or lowered and the decision is by simple majority. The voting
   record is made public, as is a rationale statement by each person
   on why he voted the way he did. These rationale statements serve to
   bring transparency to the process.</p>

<p><b>Where does Ben Bernanke stand on these questions?</b></p>

<p>Ben Bernanke has long favoured inflation targeting, more
   transparency and more rules.</p>

<p>Greenspan used to communicate very effectively, in his own way, and
   Greenspan's monetary policy is widely viewed as having been well
   run. But a modern country cannot rely on one person. Bernanke's
   positions are in favour of explicit rules, and greater
   transparency, so that US monetary policy is trusted at an
   institutional level, regardless of the individuals. We can expect
   the US Federal Reserve to talk more openly about what it is
   thinking. We may also get institutional change in the US Fed to
   take it closer to the UK model.</p>

<p><b>Let's turn to India now. How does monetary policy work in India?</b></p>

<p>In India the RBI does not have a specific inflation target. While
   it would be ideal for the RBI to have such a target, today the RBI
   is burdened with conflicting objectives such as exchange rate
   targeting, mananging the government debt and regulating banks and
   this makes it difficult for the RBI to follow a single goal, as is
   being done in advanced countries which, as a consequence, have been
   able to keep inflation at very low levels. So for example, if there
   is pressure on the rupee to appreciate, if the RBI's objective
   function had been to target inflation, it would have allowed the
   rupee to appreciate making imports cheaper and keeping inflation
   down. So despite sharply rising dollar prices of oil, India could
   have seen a somewhat slower increase in the rupee price of
   oil. However, the RBI which also tries to manage the rupee
   prevented the rupee from appreciating to help India's exporters,
   and in the process allowed inflation to move up.</p>

<p><b>What is the importance of  "rules vs discretion" in a democracy?</b></p>

<p>In a democracy, every arm of government must be open and
   transparent, so as to ensure that it works for the interests of the
   people. Non-transparency by any government agency has been a tool
   for concealment of incompetence and theft. We need to debate
   whether it is more important to keep inflation down or to help
   exporters. This is a zero sum game where one's gain is another's
   loss. So, for example, when you keep the rupee weak, you transfer
   resources from the general consumer who has a significant import
   content in her consumption basket (such as oil) to exporters who
   can make higher profits because of the weaker rupee. The decision
   to do this must be public. Discretion prevent that from happening.</p>

<p><b>If the world is moving towards central banks run on rules why
   should it matter for India?</b></p>

<p>One obvious reason is that when around 20 countries in the world
are benefitting from better structuring and running central banks, why
should Indians have to suffer from antiquated arrangements. But at a
more pragmatic level, this aspect is triply important in a developing
country with foreign capital in the picture. If foreign capital trusts
and respects the central bank, then foreign capital in the country
will be more stable.</p>

<p><b>So what should the India do?</b></p>

<p>Many decades ago, central banks said that they would lean against
   the wind, and that was enough. Today, it is important to define
   what you mean by the word wind, define how wind is measured, and
   tell how you will respond to what kinds of wind in the future. </p>
