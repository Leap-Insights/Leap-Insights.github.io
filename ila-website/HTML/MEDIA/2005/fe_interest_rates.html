 Will interest rates go up?

<p>The US Federal Reserve has raised the fed funds rate for the ninth
time. More hikes are expected. In India, the RBI raised rates in
April. Are interest rates in India set to go up further? Will the fact
that inflation is now low, keep interest rates unchanged? Rising oil
prices, domestic demand conditions and the current account deficit
suggest that there is a case for RBI to raise rates. The monetary policy review on July 26 could see the RBI announce a hike in
interest rates. The hike may, like the fed fund rate increase of 25
basis points, be quite small.</p>
<p>In the credit policy announcement in April, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy
raised the reverse repo rate, the short-term interest rate, for
2005-06. He left the bank rate, which is the medium term rate, and the
cash reserve ratio of banks, which determines how much banks can lend,
unchanged. In this way he tried to counter the upward pressure on
inflation, without hurting the industrial growth recovery taking
place. Raising the short term rate gave the indication that rates were
on their way up, without immediately raising borrowing rates. It also
helped suck excess liquidity out of the system. The policy seems to
have worked reasonably well. Even though RBI continued to intervene in
foreign exchange markets, raising liquidity in the system, inflation
did not spike and growth has not faltered.</p>
<p>The lastest data shows that inflation has touched a 2 year low of 4.1
percent (for the week ending June 18). But can we depend on it to
remain low with no further policy intervention? Global oil prices have
risen far beyond expecations. If they continue to rise, domestic oil
prices may have to be raised yet again. Growth in industry is healthy,
the fiscal deficit is high, and the pressure on demand is likely to
remain. In addition, the monsoon may not be normal.</p> 
<p>What are the options before the RBI? It could do nothing if it is
completely confident of low inflation. But given the above scenario,
it may take a more cautious approach. One option would be to raise
interest rates. The choice may be between raising the reverse repo
rate, the bank rate, the cash reserve ratio or to use any other
instrument that Dr Reddy feels is suitable, that would have the effect
of raising rates.  The rate increase is unlikely to be high. Perhaps
something that leads to a 25 basis point increase in the short term
rate. Dr. Reddy has, in the past, followed a policy of caution, and it
has served him well. In this case too, Dr. Reddy may like to be
cautious.</p>
<p>When inflation is on account of supply side factors, it is risky to
raise interest rates. An oil price shock which puts pressure on the
cost side of companies, combined with an interest rate shock, which
puts further pressure on costs and pulls down retail consumer demand,
can push industry into recession. Morevoer, as the banker to the
government, the RBI is unlikely to want to place a much higher burden
of interest payment on the government. An increse in interest rates
will also hurt banks, most of whom have interest rate risk
exposure. The hike must therefore be small.</p>
<p>An additional option for controlling inflation, if and when it occurs,
is an appreciation of the rupee dollar rate. This will reduce the
rupee price of imported products especially oil, and help to control the
price rise. However, in the next few months, left to itself, there may
be pressure on the rupee to depreciate. On the current account, both
the oil and the non-oil import bill are likely to rise if oil prices
keep rising, and the domestic economy does not slow down. On the
capital account, the rise in US interest rates and the narrow
differential between foreign and domestic interest rates, is unlikely
to attract inflows. Without the expectations of appreciation the
existing interest differential will become even more unattractive. The
RBI will have the option of selling dollars to engineer an
appreciation. This will also help suck out liquidity from the
system. The RBI may be constrained in the use of this option by the
loss of competitivenness of exports. Foreign exchange intervention to
create rupee appreciation may thus, if utilised, only be a short term
and limited option. It is unlikely to be used as the only tool to
control inflation. It can be used in conjunction with the interest
rate policy.</p>
