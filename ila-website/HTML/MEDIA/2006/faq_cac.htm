On the current account, we<br>importrefrigerators or export steel. On the current account, we<br>import insuranceservices, export software, receive remitances from a<br>sibling in England, orsend money abroad to a child attending college<br>in New Zealand. All theseare current account transactions. Today,<br>India has &quot;current accountconvertibility&quot; in the sense that you are<br>free to buy foreign exchangefor the purpose of importing goods or<br>services. In other words the rupee isconvertible on the current<br>account.<br><br><br>What is the capitalaccount?<br><br>A country's capital account is a statement of the money thatenters or<br>goes out of the country on account of investment or borrowing. Ifan<br>Indian company takes a loan from an American bank, the loan showsup<br>as an entry in the capital account. If a UK company invests in a<br>factoryin India, this is classified as Foreign Direct Investment<br>(FDI) and showsup in the capital account. When foreigners buy shares<br>in Indian companiestheir investment shows up as portfolio investment<br>on the capital account.These are examples of inflows of<br>capital. Similarly, there are examples ofoutward capital flows. For<br>example, when the Tatas purchased Tetley andDaewoo, capital from<br>India went abroad. A key facet of capital accountconvertibility is<br>where Indian households, and not just firms, buy assetsoutside the<br>country.<br><br>The capital account is about our portfolios.It is where we invest in<br>global assets, and global portfolios invest inIndian assets. It is<br>about foreigners buying Indian shares, bonds, realestate, or giving<br>loans to Indians. Conversely, it is about globaldiversification for<br>households in India.<br><br>Today the rupee is notfully convertible on the capital account as<br>there exist restrictions onmoney that comes in to buy assets in India<br>or that goes out of India toacquire assets abroad. Even though we do<br>not have full capital accountconvertibility, India's capital account<br>has been opening up slowly andsteadily since 1993.<br><br><br>How open is India's capital accounttoday?<br><br>Currently there are restrictions on the capital account. Thereare<br>limits to Indian companies borrowing abroad. There are restrictionson<br>foreigners investing in India. For example, in some sectors such as<br>telecomand media there are limits on the share the foreign partner<br>can hold. Thereare also restrictions on foreigners buying shares of<br>Indian companies. Onlyforeign institutional investors (FIIs) can hold<br>shares in Indian companies,individuals cannot. In addition, there are<br>restrictions on the amount thatan FII can hold.<br><br>There are many more restrictions on Indians sendingmoney abroad<br>that does not have to do with importing goods or services.Purchasing<br>a company is allowed but limits exist on the amount that canbe<br>sent. Global diversification of household portfolios is practically<br>nonexistent.<br><br><br>Whatwill full capital account convertibility do?<br><br>With full capital accountconvertibility, there will be no<br>restrictions for foreigners seeking to buyIndian assets. Conversely,<br>there will be no restrictions for Indianhouseholds or companies<br>taking rupees out or bringing foreign exchange fordoing global<br>diversification.<br><br><br>Who has full capital accountconvertibility in the world?<br><br>All mature market economies of the worldhave full<br>convertibility. Among the big economies India and China areroughly<br>the only places where important controls are still left.<br><br><br>Whyis capital account convertibility desirable?<br><br>There are four sets ofreasons.<br><br>First, it is good for India if foreigners come into India andinvest<br>in Indian assets - this makes more capital available forIndia's<br>development. In economist jargon, it reduces the cost of capital.When<br>steel imports are made easier, steel becomes cheaper in<br>India.Similarly, when inflows of capital into India are made easier,<br>capitalbecomes cheaper in India. More projects become viable at a<br>lower cost ofcapital.<br><br>Second, it is good for India if Indian households areglobally<br>diversified in their portfolios - this reduces risk and stabilisesthe<br>economy. A globally diversified equity portfolio has roughly halfthe<br>risk of an Indian equity portfolio. So the benefits are quite<br>large.What this means is that even when conditions are bad in India,<br>globallydiversified households will be buoyed by offshore assets,<br>will be able tospend more, and thus prop up the Indian economy.<br><br>Third, if India triesto have controls on the capital account, these<br>are rather easy to evadethrough various unscrupulous means. A big<br>license-permit raj has beensetup, but it merely achieves corruption<br>and inefficiency - in practice,huge amounts of capital are moving<br>across the border anyway. It is betterfor India if these transactions<br>happen in white money. Pushing forconvertibility is about reducing<br>the size of the black economy. This willimprove law and order, tax<br>compliance and corporate governance.<br><br>Fourth,and most important, convertibility induces competition against<br>Indianfinance. Currently, Indian finance is a monopoly in <br>intermediating thesavings of Indian households for the investment<br>plans of Indian firms. Nomatter how inefficient Indian finance is,<br>the households and firms do nothave an alternative, thanks to capital<br>controls. With convertibility,Indian savings will have the choice of<br>moving to offshore venues, and firmswill have the choice of financing<br>projects offshore. This will bring competitionto bear on Indian<br>finance. Exactly as we saw with trade liberalisation,which<br>consequently led to lower prices and superior quality of goods<br>producedin India, capital account liberalisation will improve the<br>quality and dropthe price of financial intermediation in India. This<br>will haverepercussions for Indian GDP growth, since finance is the<br>`brain' of theeconomy.<br><br><br>How can capital controls be evaded?<br><br>The currentaccount has seen sharp growth since 1991 and spectacular<br>growth since 2000after which it has increased by nearly 2.5 times as<br>both imports andexports have risen sharply. In 2004-05, inflows and<br>outflows on the currentaccount added up to $313 billion, or 48% of<br>GDP.<br><br>As a country'strade integration with the world increases, there are<br>innumerable nodesthrough which money flows in and out. To account for<br>the purpose of eachflow becomes difficult. For example, gems and<br>jewellery and software areamong India's biggest exports. Who is to<br>say whether the true value of apolished gem is USD 100 or USD 1<br>million? Who is to say what is the truevalue of a software programme?<br><br>Indian companies have opened officesall over the world. These can be<br>used to show trade transactions that canbe easily overinvoiced or<br>underinvoices. Thus, companies and individualscan now circumvent<br>capital controls and move money in and out of thecountry. As the<br>trade account becomes larger, there is increasing de factocapital<br>account convertibility, especially for those who are in thebusiness<br>of importing and exporting, the lucky ones with relatives andfriends<br>abroad and dishonest citizens who are able to engage inillegal<br>activites. The only ones who are hurt by capital controls arehonest<br>residents.<br><br><br>What will CAC mean for Indian householdsand companies?<br><br>Indian households and companies will be able to freelybuy and sell<br>rupees legally in India and abroad, to invest in foreignequity to<br>give loans, take loans, accept foreign investment. There will beno<br>questions asked when rupees are converted into dollars or yen, no<br>formsto fill, no limits to be adhered to. The rupee will be a hard<br>currency.<br><br><br>Whatare the dangers of CAC to the Indian economy?<br><br>As more money flows inand out of the country it becomes difficult to<br>control the price of therupee due to the large amounts involved. This<br>could raise difficulties forthe RBI which could have to buy or sell<br>larger and larger amounts ofdollars if it wished to manipulate the<br>rupee dollar rate. It would end upbuilding up even larger reserves<br>than it has currently. These createdifficulties in setting interest<br>rates according to the needs of the Indianeconomy. Capital account<br>convertibility means that eventually the rupee hasto be allowed to<br>become more flexible.<br><br><br>Then why is Indiaopting for full capital account convertibility at<br>this stage?<br><br>Witheffective convertibility already in place for all except honest<br>citizens, apolicy that penalises honest Indian citizens becomes<br>indefensible. Shiftingto convertibility is, to a significant extent,<br>about converting the de factoto the de jure. Moreover, the case for<br>manipulation of the exchange rate ofthe rupee by the RBI is<br>weak. India is a strong and growing economy. Whenimports rise faster<br>than exports and not being finaced by capital flows, weare likely to<br>witness a weaker rupee. If the rupee were to be artificiallypropped<br>up, it would be bad policy as it would be making expensiveimports<br>cheap and encourage their consumption. As the economy growsand<br>becomes larger, these mistakes would become even more expensive. These<br>aregood times when inflation is low, when our exports and imports are<br>doingwell, when fiscal deficits are on a path to correction and when<br>India hasmountains of foreign exchange reserves. This is a good time<br>to set forth ona path to CAC.<br><br><br>Why is it said that the East Asian Crisis led toconcerns about<br>convertibility?<br><br>Many East Asian countriesexperienced a massive exit of capital across<br>the border, based on a flightboth by local citizens and by<br>foreigners. This is commonly interpreted asbeing a problem with<br>convertibility. However, what really happened in EastAsia was<br>mistakes about exchange rate management. Central banks wereactive<br>manipulators of currency markets, and had run out of instrumentsto<br>sustain artificial exchange rates. When it became clear thatmassive<br>devaluations were in store, everyone ran for the exits.<br><br>Thelesson of the East Asian Crisis is that central banks should not<br>engage inmarket manipulation. Attributing the crisis to convertibility<br>is mistakinga symptom for a cause.<br><br><br>What are the risks in having CAC? Wheremight trouble arise?<br><br>In the international experience withconvertibility, the weakest link<br>tends to be banking. Banks have very highdebt - they have a<br>debt-equity ratio of 20. This extreme leverage goes withextreme<br>risk. Slight mistakes by the CEO can lead to bankruptcy. As an<br>example,banks themselves generally refuse to lend to a private<br>company which has adebt equity ratio of more than 2.<br><br>Though the level of loans gone bad -called Non Performing Assets or<br>NPAs - with banks in India is not veryhigh, it is well understood<br>that the incentive structure of a bank owned bythe government could<br>be warped. A bank owned by the government knows thatit will not be<br>allowed to go bankrupt. This is a serious problem in India,where 80%<br>of bank deposits are with PSU banks.<br><br>A bank could easilytake on a lot of currency risk. So, for example, a<br>bank could borrowcheaply abroad in yen and lend at much higher<br>interest rates in India. Itscalculations about the profits it expects<br>to make could go horribly wrongif the yen rupee exchange rate changes<br>drastically. Since the governmentowns these banks the foreign loans<br>taken by the banks are effectively loanstaken by the government and<br>the government will stand by and honorthem.<br><br>Hence, the safe thing for India to do is to move forward onall<br>aspects of convertibility now, but retain tight controls on the<br>globalisationof banking for a few years.<br><br>--<br><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div><HR><p><a href="../index.html">Back up to <i>Ila Patnaik's media page</i></a></p></body></html>
