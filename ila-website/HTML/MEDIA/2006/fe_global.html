<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last week's fall in stock markets in
India was part of a global story</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in which stock markets fell all over
the world, beginning with the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">US. Why did US markets fall and why did
Indian markets repond more</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sharply than anywhere else? Aasset
prices are ultimately made by the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expectations of millions of investors
across the globe. But in this</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">situation, we can obtain a little
insight through macroeconomics.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, what happened in India? Nifty
fell by 12.65 percent over six</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">days. The decline on Thursday was the
sharpest, when it fell by 6.77</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent. On Friday it fell another 4.2
percent. Over the previous five</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">days, US stock prices dropped 3%. Stock
prices had done badly all over</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Asia. All Asian markets did badly on
Thursday - Australia (-1.85%),</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hong Kong (-2.1%), Indonesia (-4.2%),
South Korea (-2.59%).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The indexes moved by a large amount in
absolute terms. This merely</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reflected the fact that the indexes are
at their highest levels</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ever. When the drop is expressed in
percent, this puts things in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">perspective. Even though bigger in
absolute terms, the 18 May 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">decline was smaller - in percent - than
the famous market crash of 17</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">May 2004 after the general elections.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did this decline take place? There
has been a lot of discussion</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">about global imbalances -- the twin
deficit of the US, the trade</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">surplus of China and undervaluation of
the yuan, in recent years. What</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is new? First, there is recent data
about low consumer confidence, a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">leading indicator of demand. Consumer
confidence in the US has dropped</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to levels prevalent around September
2001. In addition, there is a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">softness in the US housing market:
confidence among home builders is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">at the lowest level since 1995. People
feel less wealthy when their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">houses are cheaper and spend less. In
addition, with rising interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rates, mortgage payments have gone up
over the last two years, and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">higher oil prices have raised energy
bills. All this squeezes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure by households.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In response to rising oil prices and
dollar depreciation, US markets</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have been expecting higher inflation.
This is reflected in the yields</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on 10-year bonds which have picked up,
as have the inflation</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expectations visible in prices of
inflation-indexed bonds. By some</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">estimates, expected inflation in the US
has risen to 2.75 percent, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">level it was in mid-2004 when the Fed
tightening began. This view,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">about higher US inflation, was
validated by a data release on 17 May</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">showing high US inflation. It is hence
now felt that the US Fed will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">raise rates.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Higher US interest rates affect India
in two ways. First, slower</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth in the US economy affects Indian
exporters. It will also</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">accentuate pricing pressure from
Chinese competitors. But equally</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">importantly, in places across the world
like China and India, which</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">peg their exchange rates to the US,
there is a lack of monetary policy</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">autonomy owing to the use of the pegged
exchange rate. These countries</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">will experience tighter monetary policy
also, in synchrony with</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">tighter monetary policy in the US.
Intuitively, higher interest rates</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in the US will lead to capital leaving
India, and could lead to a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">weaker rupee. And to the extent that
India tries to prevent the rupee</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dollar rate from moving sharply, we
will be forced to raise rates in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">order to defend the rupee. Thus tight
monetary policy in the US</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">coupled with a INR/USD pegged exchange
rate will generate tight</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">monetary policy in India.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this cannot be the full
explanation. After all, most Asian</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">economies, like India, peg their
currencies to the USD. So</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">international macroeconomics can
perhaps account for a 3% drop in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian stock prices. The remaining 8%
drop has to do with domestic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">news. Recent news about policy in India
has not been good. The quotas,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the victory of the Left in West Bengal
and Kerala which may further</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">weaken the move towards market oriented
reforms and the insecurity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">created by the SEBI order against
market participants that account for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">nearly 60 percent of customer accounts
could have been some of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">factors shaping the large move seen in
India. Obviously, GOI can do</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">little to correct global imbalances,
the only thing it can focus on is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to keep reforms on track and help build
confidence in stock markets in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the country.</P>
