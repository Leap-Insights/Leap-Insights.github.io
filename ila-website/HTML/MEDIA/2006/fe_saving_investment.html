<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/the-euphoria-over-increasing-savings-rate/106272/" style="text-decorating:none" >Financial Express</a>, 28 March 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the euphoria about the headline data
about the sharp rise in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">gross savings rate in India, one fine
detail has been ignored : the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">maximum increase in savings has come
from the most unreliable source - 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">public sector savings. Before we raise
our hopes about savings,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investment and growth in India, and
before we start thinking that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">higher GDP growth will give the
government higher taxes and more money</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to spend on employment guarantee
programmes and pay commission</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">recommendations, we need to pause to
refect upon the source of higher</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">savings which is supposed to make all
this possible.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First the arithmetic. In period from
2001-02, there has been an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increase in the investment rate by 7
percent of GDP. The investment</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rate rose from 23 percent in 2001-02 to
30.1 percent in 2004-05. This</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investment was financed by a rise in
both the gross savings rate and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">net capital flows from abroad. The
domestic savings rate rose over</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this period from 23.6 percent in
2001-02 to 29.1 percent in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2004-05. The net capital inflow swung
from a net outflow of capital</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from India of 0.7 percent of GDP in
2001-02, to 0.8 percent of net</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflow of capital into India in
2004-05.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Public savings consist of dissaving by
the government and savings of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">public sector enterprises. Public
savings have shown a remarkable</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">swing. In 2001-02 the public sector as
a whole was making losses of Rs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">46,377 crore. In 2004-05 the government
and public sector enterprises</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">together saved Rs 69,390 crore. This
was a shift from -2.0 percent to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a postitive of 2.2 percent of GDP.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One part of the increase in the public
saving rate has been achieved</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by fiscal consolidation at both the
state and central levels. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">combined revenue deficit of the central
and state governments has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fallen sharply from 7.0 percent of GDP
to 3.4 percent in 2005-06</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Budget Estimate). The combined fiscal
deficit of the centre and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">states has fallen from 9.9 percent of
GDP to 7.7 percent over this</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">period. A higher growth in revenues at
a time when the economy is on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the upswing of a business cycle has
made the improvement in public</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">finances possible. While one can hope
that the FRBM will tie the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hands of the centre as well as the
states that have adopted it, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">cyclical aspect of tax revenues must
not be forgotten. Lower GDP</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth would mean lower savings as
taxes have higher buoyancy than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditures.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Though the deficit of the government
has fallen as a share of GDP, it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">has increased in rupee terms. This
increase has, however, been offset</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by the profit growth in public sector
enterprises which has resulted</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in a swing from a public sector deficit
to a surplus. Most public</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sector enterprises make losses. In
general, only PSUs that are in a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">monopolistic position such as oil
companies and banks are able to make</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">profits. Retained profits by such
companies is the primary source of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the observed increase in savings.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Corporate savings, which reflect higher
retained profits of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">private corporate sector, have also
risen from 3.6 percent of GDP in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2001-02 to 4.8 percent of GDP in
2004-05. One element of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">explanation for the increase in profits
in both PSUs and the corporate</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sector is that the period under
discussion is one in which industry is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on the upswing of a business cycle.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Profits are amongst the first to be hit
when a business cycle turns</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and should not be thought of as giving
a &quot;trend&quot; increase in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">savings rate. An increase in savings is
more likely to be permanent</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">when it comes from households. But
household savings, where a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">'demographic dividend' in terms of a
larger and younger earning</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">population with higher incomes is
expeced to raise the household</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">savings rate, is yet to see a rise.
Household savings as percentage of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">GDP remained flat at 22 percent. While
it is correct to think that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">India's household savings rate will
rise because of the demographic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">shift taking place in the population
today that is reducing the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dependency ratio, the shift could take
about a decade.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In conclusion, the details about the
source of higher savings suggest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that there is no room for complacency.
The government should continue</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to control its expenditure, rather than
make plans to expand it.</P>
