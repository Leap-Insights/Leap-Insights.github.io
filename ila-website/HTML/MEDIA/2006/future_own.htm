This is good for tribals, good for<br>tigers, and good for India's economic growth.<br><br>On February 2nd the government will launch the Naional Rural Employement<br>Programme in 200 districts. The UPA has shown its willingness to spend<br>money on the employment guarantee bill despite the impact on the<br>exchequer. The tribal bill however appears to be getting step-motherly<br>treatment-- especially when it comes to spending money by the central<br>government. Considering that the money needed is much lower, a<br>one-time cost and makes economic sense -- it will raise GDP and taxes<br>in the future -- this is not good economic policy. If the UPA<br>government is serious about the welfare of both tribals and tigers,<br>Budget 2006 must allocate Rs 10,000 crores for the relocation of the<br>tribals out of tiger reserves.<br><br>According to the tribals bill, if tribals are not relocated out of<br>tiger reserves within the next 5 years they will be given permanent<br>rights over their piece of sanctury land. Though the bill has been<br>passed by the Central Government, the responsibilty of relocating<br>tribal populations from tiger reserves has been left to the state<br>governments. Unless money is allocated by the Central Government,<br>cash-starved state governments on whom this responsibility has been<br>dumped, will be unable to do any serious relocation.<br><br>Sariska is a chilling example. As reports in the Indian Express<br>revealed, all tigers in the Sariska tiger reserve were killed as a<br>consequence of the lax law enforcement that results from human<br>populations inhabiting tiger reserves. Now the Rajasthan Government<br>plans to reintroduce tigers into the reserve. However, the state<br>government does not plan to relocate the tribals. This will leave the<br>core problem unsolved.<br><br>If 5 years go by without relocating tribals out of reserves, the<br>problem will become even bigger. There will be land within tiger<br>reserves that will have to be divided up among tribal families who now<br>own it collectively. The protection of tigers would become much more<br>difficult if human habitation in the reserves was to turn to permanent<br>settlements.<br><br>Experts have argued that the two issues of conserving the tiger and<br>protecting the rights of tribals should be clearly separate objectives<br>and separate land needs to be kept aside for achieving each of these<br>objectives. India can afford to put aside 2 percent of land to house<br>2,500 tigers. The findings of the Tiger task force set up by Prime<br>Minister Manhohan Singh as a response to the Sariska killings clearly<br>indicates that one of the most serious problems in protecting the<br>tiger has been the continued habitations of humans inside tiger<br>reserves. Wherever there are areas where humans have access, the<br>limitations of the policing powers of the forest guards, as well as<br>the incentives provided by criminal gangs involved in tiger poaching<br>have made it difficult to protect the tiger. The task force estimates<br>that around Rs 10,000 crore will be needed for relocation of the<br>tribles in Project Tiger reserves.<br><br>If separating tribals from tigers is important for tigers, it is<br>equally important for the tribals. Proposals to keep tribals inside<br>tiger reserves do injustice to tribals. Tribals are people, just like<br>us, and have a right to participate in the Indian economy. Relocating<br>tribals outside wildlife sancturies will help improve their living<br>standards, health and education. The lifestyles of tribals continuing<br>to live in wildlife sancturies will not improve, as they will be<br>contrained by life inside a wildlife sanctury which is optimised for<br>animals and not humans. It is callous to prevent the tribals, as much<br>citizens of India as any of us, from reaping the fruits of India's<br>growth. Tribals inside tiger reserves generally live in deep<br>poverty. They will not even have access to the employment guarantee<br>scheme. Instead of aiming to maintaining their poverty ridden<br>lifestyles, there must be an active programme to take them out of<br>these areas and relocate them in areas where they are able to reap the<br>fruits of India's growth, and have access to schools, hospitals, roads<br>and markets.<br><br>Spending money on relocating tribals from tiger reserves makes huge<br>commercial sense for India. In 2004-05, more than 3.6 million foreign<br>tourists visited India. The Indian tiger in the wild is a huge tourist<br>attraction. The hotel industry that grows around tiger tourism cannot<br>exist without it. Today the hotel industry adds Rs 26,000 crore to<br>Indian GDP. Travel is the biggest and fastest-growing sector in the<br>world. Indian tourism and hotels will stand to gain hugely if we can<br>protect the Indian tiger.<br><br>Raising a loan of Rs 10,000 crore or US dollars 2 billion from within<br>India, and from international agencies working for the welfare of<br>tribals and wildlife, should not be difficult. Foreign visitors<br>flocking to India's tiger reserves show clearly enough that the<br>excitement of seeing a tiger will bring enough tourists to India year<br>after year as long as we are able to make sure that the tigers<br>exist. They will bring money and business to pay back the loan.<br><br>Even if we attach zero importance to biodiversity as an end in itself,<br>and only focus on money, we must comparew the increased tourism<br>revenues with vibrant tiger populations, versus the reduced tourism<br>revenues when the tiger becomes extinct. We will be better off, purely<br>from a commercial point of view in making this investment of Rs.10,000<br>crore. Nobody can know these numbers exactly, but simple calculations<br>suggest that if India manages to stay on course with sound economic<br>growth, the tourism revenues over the next 30 years easily yield a net<br>present value which is much greater than Rs.10,000 crore. It makes<br>business sense for India to spend Rs.10,000 crore on relocating<br>adivasis, even if we attach no value to biodiversity other than as a<br>tool for obtaining tourist revenues.<br><br>Another aspect of this is that the resettlement cost will grow in the<br>future, reflecting rising wages and asset prices in India. Ideally,<br>the government should have bitten the bullet and done this in 1973,<br>when Project Tiger was created - it would have been dramatically<br>cheaper then. We should recognise the mistake, and not put off<br>relocation further.<br><br>---</p></div><HR><p><a href="../index.html">Back up to <i>Ila Patnaik's media page</i></a></p></body></html>
