<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Much as the UPA would like to believe
that its social security</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">programmes would eradicate poverty,
there seems to be no better</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty alleviation programme than
growth. The decline in poverty in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">India reported by NSS data for 2004-05
has not happened because of any</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">well-targeted anti-poverty programmes,
or because the NDA stepped up</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure on anti-poverty programmes.
It happened because of higher</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth. And, interestingly, it has
happened not only in India, but</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">also in most of South Asia.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A recent study shows interesting
evidence. Quietly, without most of us</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">noticing, some of the poorest countries
in the world -- South Asian</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">countries -- have obtained strong
growth and a sharp reduction in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty in the last five to ten years.
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maldives and Pakistan have all grown at
more than 5 percent per year</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on average over the last 5 years. A
recent paper titled &quot;Economic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Growth in South Asia: Promising,
Un-equalising,...Sustainable?&quot; by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shantayan Devarajan and Ijaz Nabi of
the Worth Bank examines the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">impact of the growth on poverty (url:

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Bangladesh, India and Nepal, all
three among the poorest countries</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in the world, a decade of economic
growth led to a reduction in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">proportion of population below the
poverty line by 9, 10 and 11</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percentage points respectively. In
Bangladesh it fell from 59 percent</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in the begining of the 1990s to 50
precent. In Nepal it fell from 42</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent to 31 percent. In Sri Lanka
where the growth rate in the last</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">5 years was 4.7 percent, poverty fell
by 6 percentage points. Pakistan</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">witnessed economic stagnation in the
1990s, and consequently saw an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increase in poverty in the decade.
Looking back at the 1980s, when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pakistan grew well, we find that there
was a 12 percentage points</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reduction in poverty over the 1980s.
There is recent survey evidence</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to show that high growth in the
post-2001 period in Pakistan has led</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to a reduction in poverty.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Further, their estimates suggest that
if South Asian coutries were</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">able to sustain high rates of growth,
they could achieve a significant</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reduction in poverty. While it is true
that such estimates are based</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on past patterns in the economy, on
several assumptions between income</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and consumption growth and poverty
elasticity of the economy to income</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth, and are at best indicative,
they do show that apparently small</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">differences in growth rates matter
substantially to poverty reduction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Projections for poverty incidence in
2013 with a 7 percent growth rate</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and a 10 growth rate show the impact of
growth-oriented policies for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty reduction. Bangladesh today has
a 50 percent poverty rate. If</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the Bangladesh economy were to grow at
a sustained 10 percent for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">next 7 years, the incidence of poverty
could be brought down to 13</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent! And, growth was to be
sustained even at 7 percent, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty rate would get down to 20
percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pakistan today has a poverty rate of 35
percent. A sustained 10</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent growth for 7 years, which would
double Pakistan's GDP by 2013,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">would bring poverty down to 8 percent! 
Sri Lanka's poverty</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rate could similarly be reduced from
23% at present to 4% with 10</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent growth, or 10% with 7 percent
growth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most interesting reasoning, of
course, pertains to India. Going by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">existing growth rates, there are two
alternative projections for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian poverty rate in 2013.  Devarajan
and Nabi find that if India</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">continues to grow at 7 percent, poverty
will be down to 15 percent in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2013. In addition, the Eleventh Plan
approach paper finds that over</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the last 5 years, poverty in India has
been dropping at an annual rate</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of 0.79 percentage points. Projecting
into 2013 using this, we get an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">estimate of 16 percent for 2013. It is
reassuring that these two</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">estimates are similar to each other.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Devarajan and Nabi additionally
estimate that if Indian growth were to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">accelerate to 10%, poverty in India is
likely to get down to 13</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent by 2013. In other words, such
an acceleration in growth would</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">get an additional 30 million people out
of poverty by 2013. Those who</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">focus on poverty need to focus on this
number. No redistribution</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">scheme can have the impact economic
growth can have. High economic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth is the best poverty alleviation
programme.
