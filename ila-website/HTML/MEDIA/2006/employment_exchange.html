<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Employment exchanges spend Rs 20 crore
to fill 902 vacancies</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian Expres, May 3, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A recent report on employment exchanges
in Delhi shows that in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">last five years only 902 candidates out
of the 5 lakh who registered</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">were given jobs through the exchanges.
The report, on the State of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Governance in Delhi by the Centre for
Civil Society, reveals that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">these 902 placements were made at a
cost of Rs 20 crore. In other</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">words, each placement cost the
government a whopping Rs 2.3 lakh.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were made by the 20 employment
exchanges in Delhi where</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">approximately 250 government staff
work. In 2000 they made 123</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">placements, in 2001 only 48 placements
were made, in 2002 the number</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rose to 138. After a spike in 2003 to
426, placements fell to 167 in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2004. On average, for every staff
member barely one placement was made</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">every year.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it is not the staff at the
employment exchanges who are to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">blame. In an era where both the private
sector and government</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">enterprises manage their own
recruitment work, there is little that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">comes the way of employment exchanges.
The exchanges are not meant to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">cater to the private sector. Initially
their main activity was to make</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">placements with public sector
undertakings. Today the Staff Selection</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Commission, the Railways Recruitment
Board, the Banking Service</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Commission and other recruiting
agencies do the job for PSUs. It is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">not surprising that only stray cases of
lower level jobs come the way</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of employment exchanges.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A lot of time and effort is spent
registering with these</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exchanges. Over the last five years,
from 2000 to 2004, when these 902</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">placements were made, the number of
people who registered with these</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">20 exchanges was an amazing 5,39,734.
To register with an employment</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exchange in Delhi it is required that
one has been a resident of Delhi</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">for at least a period of three years.
Proof of residence in the form</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of ration cards issued at least a year
before, or inclusion of name in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the electoral list has to be provided.
In addition, a certificate of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">educational qualifications from an
institution in Delhi has to be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">provided.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This problem is not restricted to
Delhi. According to the Annual</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Report of the Ministry of Labour,
2005-06, the Directorate of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Employment runs 947 employment
exchanges in the country with a total</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">staff strength of 2527. The data on
placements made by all exchanges</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is not easily available, but what is
available, is similar to what is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reported for Delhi. For example,
statistics from the Vishakhapatnam</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">District Employment Exchange show that
in 2001 while the live</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">registrations of the candidates for
technical and unskilled jobs was</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">82,871, the number of vacancies was 246
and placements were only</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">67. In the clerical category, while the
live register showed 1,51,933</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">candidates, the number of vacancies
notified during 2001 were 112 and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">placements were 50.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the government is talking about
redefining the role of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment exchange to find more work
for the staff and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">computerisation for better information
flow and modern methods, there</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is actually a need to question the very
need for the government running</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment exchanges when both the
private sector and various</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">recruitment agencies of the public
sector appear to be doing a much</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">better job. The impact of employment
exchanges does not justify the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure on them. It is a blessing
that the money budgeted for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Directorate of Employment does not get
spent. In the Ninth Five Year</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plan the Delhi government was able to
spend only Rs 2 crore out of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rs 3.5 crore available.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking ahead, at the very least, the
Delhi Government can cancel the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">construction of a new Employment
Exchange building at Daryaganj</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expected to cost Rs 265 lakh. It can
also stop going ahead on spending</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rs 250 lakh to build a computerised
system to help registration. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">first best policy would be to shut down
all employment exchanges. If</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Delhi was to spend an additional Rs 4
crore on building infrastructure</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">every year, it would be able to create
more than the 200 jobs a year</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that the spending on employment
exchanges does.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lesson to be learnt from the Delhi
story is that it is time to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">wind up the Directorate of Employment.
The Directorate of Employment</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">probably had a legitimate role when it
was set up at the end of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second World War, in July 1945, with
the objective of resettling</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">soldiers returning from war. But today
other than providing employment</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">for its own staff, its impact is
negligible. The Rs 3666 crore</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">allocated to the Directorate of
Employment in the Tenth Plan was</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">serious wasteful expenditure. Instead
of restructuring and reloacting</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment exchanges, the Eleventh Plan
should aim at shutting them</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">down and relocating the 2527 government
staff working in them.</P>
