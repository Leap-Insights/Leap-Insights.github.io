<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Education, unlike most other sectors,
has not been touched by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">liberalisation. The removal of the
licence permit raj, released</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">industry from the shackles that had
prevented its growth. Telecom</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">blossomed after entry into the sector
was liberalised. The aviation</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sector gave consumers access and low
prices. But education has been</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">left mostly untouched.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Consider this. To open a school an
association or group of individuals</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">first has to register as a society with
a non-profit motive. Next, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">society needs to apply for a licence
called the &quot;Essentiality</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Certificate&quot; (EC). The EC is like
the industrial licence of the old</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">days which is issued if the government
decides that there is a need</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">for another school in the area. The
number of ECs the Department of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Education of a state decides to issue
each year for each zone and each</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">kind of school -- primary, upper
primary and secondary -- are decided</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by the department in an arbitrary
manner, without any objective</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">criterion. It is supposed to depend on
its estimate of demand and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">supply made by the deparment. This
restriction on supply often creates</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a situation where there are more
children in the school going ages</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">than the number of seats available in
schools. Students then have to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">queue up for school admissions, little
children have to take entrance</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">interviews and parents have to pay
capitation fee. The well connected</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">always have recourse to political and
social networks. This is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reminiscent of telephone connections in
the days before telecom</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">liberalisation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The story does not end there. After
obtaining an EC, the school gets</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">land, then applies for recognition,
then affiliation with a board, and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">if it wants to become an aided school,
for aid to the government who then</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pays teachers salaries. After this the
school management pays bribes to school</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inspectors every year. It often takes
more than Rs 1 crore and between</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">3 to 17 years to achieve all this.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is hardly surprising that
managements of existing schools today do</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">not want the licence raj to be removed.
They have already paid the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">costs. After all, when did the
incumbents in any closed club want entry</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to be freed up for all?  Through
restrictions on entry private schools</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have acquired monopoly status. Nor are
policymakers -- politicians and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">bureacrats -- whose children get to
study in private schools, thanks</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to their connections and their money,
fighting to take away the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exclusivity of such education.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The situation with higher education is
no different. Both Indians and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foreigners are prevented from opening
universitites and offering</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">education regardless of how large the
demand might be. The rich can</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">always put money in and send their
children to universities abroad. If</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the government allowed universities
like Harvard, MIT and Stanford,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which are reported to be interested in
opening campuses in India, with</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">lakhs of seats at a cost much lower
than what it takes to send a child</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">abroad, higher education would be
accessible for lakhs of middle class</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children who cannot afford to go abroad
today. It is again not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">surprising that our policy makers, the
politicans and the bureaucrats,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Congressmen and Communists alike, who
can today afford to send their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children abroad and get them degrees
from universities like Harvard</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and MIT are not keen to have such
campuses in the country and make</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">such education available for lakhs of
students across the country.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Removing licences and restrictions to
entry will make education that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is exclusive today, available to the
aam admi. But until the netas and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the babus have the will to crush
entrenched interests in the sector,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">take away the clear advantages their
children have, and liberalise</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this sector, good education in India
will remain the exclusive domain</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of the rich and priviledged.</P>
