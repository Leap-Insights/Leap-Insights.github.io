<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian Express, June 13, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Assembly elections over, the
rising price of crude oil in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">international markets has finally hit
the Indian consumer. The Left,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to its credit, has done the consumer a
favour by insisting that retail</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">price rises could be avoided altogether
by cutting taxes which</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">constitute more than half the price
paid by the consumer. It</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">essentially argued that the Centre
should cut taxes. However, while 38</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent of the petrol price paid by a
consumer in Delhi goes to the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Central government, another 17 percent
goes the state goverment. So</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">when Petroleum Minister Murli Deora
asked state governments, who would</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have mopped up an additional Rs 2000
crore owing to the price hike, to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">cut sales taxes, many state governments
responded positively. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Left has a valid point. Of the Rs
43.49 per litre that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">consumer in Delhi was paying for petrol
before the hike, the value of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the petrol was Rs 20.42. The central
government levied Rs 14.63 (an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">excise duty of 8 percent plus a
specific tax of Rs 13 per litre) and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">30 paisa as education cess. Sales taxes
of 20 percent were levied on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the resulting price of Rs 35 which
meant that Rs 7.25 went to the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Delhi government. When the value of
petrol goes up then both the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exice collected by the Centre and the
sales tax collected by the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">State go up. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is unfair that whenever world crude
oil prices go up, not only does</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the consumer have to pay a higher price
for the oil, she also has to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pay additional taxes to the government.
The government actually has an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">incentive to hike petro prices as it
stands to collect</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">additional revenue. Already, the
contribution of the petroleum sector</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to the total net excise revenues of the
Government is of the order of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">40 percent. As the Left has pointed
out, to prevent the government</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from further 'profiting at the expense
of customers' the duty should</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">be a specific duty without any ad
valorem content. The Rangarajan</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">committee on Pricing and Taxation of
Petroleum products has also</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">recommended that there is a need to
shift from the current mix of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">specific and advalorem taxes to a pure
specific levy. It recommended</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that a specific levy of Rs 14.75 per
litre for petrol and Rs 5.00 per</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">litre for diesel may be imposed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since sales tax on petrol of between 20
to 34 percent comes on top of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the exice duty, the increase in the oil
price leads to a cascading</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">effect and the consumer now has to pay
more taxes to state government</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">as well. State governments obtain a
windfall gain. Since sales taxes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">were outside its purview, the
Rangarajan committee recommended that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the Empowered Committee of State
Finance Ministers for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">implementation of the VAT also be
entrusted with the task of evolving</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a uniform policy on sales tax levies on
petroleum products.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the latest price hike the
government has also accepted other</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">recommendations of the Rangarajan
committee such as a move from import</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">parity prices to trade parity prices
and a reduction in the custom</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">duties on petroleum products from 10
percent to 7.5 percent. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">recommendation of restricting
subsidised kerosene to BPL families</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">through the use of smart cards will
target the subsidy better as well</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">as prevent malpractise and adulteration
of diesel. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After sorting out the taxation issue,
Manmohan Singh needs to focus</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on how to depoliticise petro product
prices. The objective of making</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene
and LPG market determined, when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">it was first attempted in April 2002,
was manyfold. It sought to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reduce the subsidy given to these
products. It was hoped that bringing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">relative prices of petrol, diesel and
kerosene in line with costs and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">removing cross-subsidies would reduce
the incentives to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">adulterate diesel and petrol. It was
expected that this would also</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">prevent the move towards inefficient
technologies such as diesel</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fuelled cars. It was also hoped that if
prices move slowly up and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">down, it would reduce the shock to the
economy which comes when there</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is a one time price hike. This would
give the economy time to adjust</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">slowly minimizing the damage. Consumers
would accept price hikes more</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">easily when they saw daily movement of
prices in both</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">directions. Equally importantly, it was
hoped that petro product</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">prices would not longer be a
politically sensitive issue.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, two things went wrong. First,
since the owner of the oil</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">companies continues to be the
government, price decisions have remained</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">with the petroleum minister. It has
created the current system where</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">prices are not raised before an
election not to reduce the popularity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of the party in power.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second, the oil sector continued to be
protected through a system of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">licences and controls. In the long run
the oil sector requires</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exposing local oil companies to global
competition. At present, a host</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of barriers make it difficult for the
private sector to import and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sell petroleum products in the country.
In the 1990s, India reformed</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">its inefficient industrial sector -
where there were thousands of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">incompetent companies - by opening up
to imports. The same</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">prescription now needs to be made for
the petroleum sector. We should</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">focus on opening up the Indian market
for petroleum products to global</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">competition, so that consumers should
be able to fully bypass the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rules of the Ministry of Petroleum, if
they should want to. This will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">shield the Indian consumer from
inefficiency of oil companies. It will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">put the sector on the path to
meaningful adjustment to competition and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">efficiency in a globalised setting.
Free entry should be allowed in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the sector. Anyone should be allowed to
open petrol pumps, buy petrol</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from anywhere in the world and sell to
customers. This will help</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">destroy the monopoly of oil companies
and force them to work in a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">competitive framework. It will also
help prevent the government into</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">forcing policies on them that will push
them into the red.</P>
