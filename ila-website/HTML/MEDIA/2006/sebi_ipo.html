<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cleaning up the IPO market</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SEBI's order against the &quot;IPO
scam&quot; should be a chapter in the next</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">edition of Steve Levitt's Freakanomics,
a study of how incentives</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">shape the behaviour of people. SEBI's
order indicts a remarkably broad</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">swathe of finance firms. Why have
hundreds of ordinary citizens turned</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to fraud? Is this just about poor
supervision, or is there a deeper</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">problem? Does the fault lie instead
with the structure of incentives</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on the IPO market?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SEBI has barred 24 market participants
from participating in the stock</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">market for their role in the IPO scam.
The &quot;IPO scam&quot; consists of more</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">than one application per person being
put in. The guilty are said to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have been aided and abbeted in their
crime by finance companies</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">who allowed them to open multiple
accounts, get allotments and make</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">windfall gains by selling their shares.
SEBI says that these companies</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">failed to &quot;Know Their Customer&quot;
and turned a blind eye to muliple</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">names assigned to a single address. The
issue came into prominence</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">with the case of the Yes Bank IPO, when
Roopalben Panchal made tens of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">thousands of applications. SEBI has
taken action where</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">more than 20 &quot;individuals&quot;
have the same address and where more than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">500 benami entities have transfered
shares into a single account</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">before listing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How can a finance company prevent an
individual from having multiple</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">identities? When a depository
participant is shown proof of identity,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the account opening has to proceed.
India does not police every</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">citizen, and there is no unique citizen
identity. In the absence of a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">biometric identity infrastructure, it
is easy for ordinary citizens</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">people to have multiple identities.
When SEBI tried to build MAPIN, a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">system through which a unique identity
could be given to large</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investors, there was a hue and cry,
until MAPIN was finally stalled.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A person can have multiple PAN numbers,
since the income tax</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">authorities have no biometric capacity
to verify that one number maps</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to only one person. Multiple bank
accounts by a single individual are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">not uncommon. If a broker deals with
clients who belong to one company</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and they give the same address, how
will he make sure that even though</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">their address is the same, they are
different individuals?  Unless the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Government of India has a strict unique
identity system, which may be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">quite a while away given the size of
our population and the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">difficulties in implementing it, it is
quite unfair to expect the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">regulator SEBI or the finance
companies, the DPs or the depositories</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">it regulates to be able to enforce one
IPO application per person.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What would be a fair expectation from
the regulator? The power of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">regulator lies in creating an incentive
structure such that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">entities it regulates follow the
regulations it makes. The root of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">problem lies in rationing. Rationing
has given rise to black markets</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in every country and in every age from
Soviet Russia to war time</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Europe. India is seen plenty of black
markets. There were black</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">markets for steel and cement when these
were rationed. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The quota for individual investors has
created an adverse incentive</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">structure in which people try to get
allocations by all means because</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the price at the first listing is
higher than the price at which</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">shares are alloted. The situation is
similar to the one in which</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rationing leads to a black market.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When every application for cement
entitles you to 50 bags of cement,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">every child in the family puts in an
application and a family of four</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">can get 200 bags of cement. But
gangsters put in 100 applications to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">get 5000 bags of cement, which they
sell in the black market making a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">profit on each bag. As long as there is
a special quota for individual</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investors, there will be an incentive
to play such games.  Even if</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SEBI's order puts fear into the hearts
and minds of the finance</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">companies involved, Roopalben and her
ilk will be undoubtedly able to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">find loopholes in the law. More
importantly, ordinary middle class</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">households will tread into unethical
behaviour by rounding up</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">applications in the name of every
family member imaginable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How can the problem be solved? With
imported cars, custom duty</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exemptions for travel companies
encourages otherwise honest citizens</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to work around the law and pay a lower
duty for cars. With petrol</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pumps, adulteration of diesel with
kerosene occurs because kerosene is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">available at a subsidied price.
Remember the case of gold smuggling,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which continued as long as the custom
duties on gold were high. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">list is endless.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As long as there are incentives to
cheat, people try to cheat. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian State does not have the capacity
to go after pervasive</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">violations of rules by ordinary
citizens. If we do not have the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">capacity to police them, the way out is
to change the law and remove</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the incentives to cheat. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The quota for small investors in IPOs
was intended to &quot;benefit the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">small investor&quot;. Instead the
beneficiaries are those who enter the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">market to make a quick buck. Let us not
delude ourselves that the SEBI</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">order, however stern it might be, will
put an end to unethical and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fraudulent practices on the IPO market.
The COFEPOSA could not stop</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">gold smuggling for 15 years.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instead of ravaging the landscape of
the best companies in Indian</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">finance, making demands on them which
are difficult to meet, SEBI</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">needs to address the problem at the
core. There is a need to take away</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the price difference that gives the
incentive to cheat. The way to do</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this is to convert the IPO market into
a pure auction, without quotas</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">imposed by SEBI. Let all participate in
an open auction of shares so</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that the price at which the shares are
sold is a reflection of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">demand and supply rather than an
artificial scarcity. So far, SEBI has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">tried to play policeman, seeking to
implement a wrong policy. What it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">really needs to do is replace this by a
correct policy.</P>
