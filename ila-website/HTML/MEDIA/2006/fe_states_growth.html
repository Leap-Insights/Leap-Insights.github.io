</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The political class is well aware of
the &quot;revolution of rising</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expectations&quot;. There is increasing
empirical evidence that high growth</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">states are best able to attack poverty
and increase employment - that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">there is no meaningful alternative to
policies that focus on high</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">economic growth. State governments need
to focus on improving</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">infrastructure, achieving sound law and
order, and attracting</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">private investment in order to raise
growth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the level of per capita income
in 2003-04, states in India</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">can be divided into 3 groups - the rich
states, the middle-income</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">states and the poor states. Punjab,
Maharashtra, Haryana, Gujarat,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tamil Nadu are in the group of rich
states. Karnataka, Kerala, West</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are the
middle income states. Rajasthan,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, U.P and Bihar
are among the set of poor</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">states.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A recent study on growth variation in
Indian states examines the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">policies of state governments that
impact growth rates. The paper</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">titled &quot;Mind the Gap - Is economic
growth in India leaving some states</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">behind&quot; by Catriona Purfield,
finds that inequality among states has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increased in the last 30 years. The gap
in per capita income levels</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">between the richer and poorer states
has widened. In 1970, the richest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">state (Punjab) was 3.4 times richer
than the poorest (Bihar). By 2004,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this ratio had risen to 4.5.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The econometric analysis presented in
the paper finds that state-level</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">polices are a key factor influencing
the pattern of economic growth</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">across Indian states. The paper has an
interesting innovation: the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">extent of T&amp;D losses of the
electricity sector in the state is viewed</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">as a measure of the quality of
governance in the state. Three factors</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">are found to be associated with higher
growth: Greater private sector</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investment, smaller governments, and
better governance.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How does growth impact the welfare of
the electorate?  Purfield finds</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that richer and faster growing states
have been more effective in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reducing poverty and in generating
employment. A state's record in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reducing poverty reflects differences
both in the level of growth and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in the effectiveness of this growth in
reducing poverty. On average,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">richer states have been about 50
percent more effective in reducing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty than poorer states for each
percentage point of growth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the period 1977 to 2001 for which
the analysis has been conducted,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">some states have the best performance
in both indicators. Andhra</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have
high poverty elasticity and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">witnessed high growth. This is why they
were effective at reducing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty more than any of the others. 
Interestingly, Karnataka and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maharashtra, even though they witnessed
high growth in the period,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">were not as effective at reducing
poverty because of their very low</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty elasticities. Bihar, UP, and MP
had both low growth and low</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poverty elasticities giving them among
the poorest outcomes in terms</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of poverty reduction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Purfield's evidence on organised sector
employment shows that while</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment has risen across all states
in the past three decades, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pace of job creation in middle- and
high-income states far outstripped</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that of poorer states. While 40 percent
of the population lives in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poorest and most populous states, only
one-quarter of organised sector</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment is found there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is an alternative to making a
state richer: this is to allow the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">state to wallow in poverty, and rely on
migration to get people</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">out. Net outward migration is highest
from the northern</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and central states of Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, and Punjab.  The prime</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">destinations for migration are Delhi,
Maharashtra and Gujarat.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Migration is a powerful tool for
equalising incomes within the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">country. If enough people leave (say)
West Bengal, then wages in West</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bengal will go up owing to a shortage
of labour. In addition, the flow</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of remittances by the migrants will
improve consumption in West</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bengal.  Such migration flows reduce
inequalities.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While these arguments in favour of the
benefits of migration within</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the country are solid, the empirical
fact is that the existing level</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of labor mobility in India across state
borders is very low and does</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">little to reduce disparities.  Only 6
percent of migration in rural</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">areas and 20 percent of migration in
urban areas occurred across state</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">boundaries.  In other words, there is
no option but to first and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foremost focus on growth, through which
the problems of poverty and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment will be addressed.</P>
