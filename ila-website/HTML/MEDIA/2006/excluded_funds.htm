Are you<br>certainthat your company is actually investing the PF contribution it<br>is deductingfrom your salary? Most people are keenly aware about<br>their consumptionchoices, but don't have a clue when it comes to<br>their financial savings.And, that is why it is important to regulate<br>provident and pension fundsand keep an eye on what companies are<br>doing with their employees money.However, what Finance Bill 2006<br>proposes to do in this regard will causemore harm than good.<br><br>There are three possibile places your PF moneycould be in. First,<br>your money could be with the EPFO.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, your company could have an<br>'exemptfund', which is recognised by the EPFO and which pays you at<br>least as muchinterest as the EPF rate. If the company defaults you<br>will be looked afterby the EPFO which will attach the company's<br>assets and try to get yourmoney back. And third, your company could<br>hold your provident fund contributionsin an unregulated 'excluded'<br>fund under which it is looking after the fundsitself. It could be<br>that for employees with salaries below Rs.6,500 amonth, the company<br>subscribes to the EPFO or runs an exempt fund, but foremployees with<br>higher salaries, it runs its own scheme. It could even bethat it is a<br>member of the EPFO for the basic contribution rate, but foradditional<br>contributions it runs its own scheme. Or, your company mightbe<br>deducting your PF contribution, and the money is being embezzled, so<br>whenthe time comes to payout, you get nothing.<br><br>The difficulties faced byEPFO are well known. In recent years the top<br>management of the EPFO hasbeen trying to address some of its<br>problems. The problems with the 2500 oddexempt funds which are known<br>to default on contributions and havedifficulties in paying the high<br>interest rates that match the EPF rate arealso known. But almost<br>nothing is known about the 'excluded funds'. Howmany companies are<br>running their own provident fund schemes ? What schemesare they<br>offering? Do they have the ability to meet their obligations? Isthe<br>money actually invested by the company where they claim it is?What<br>happens if the company goes bankrupt? What if the money isstolen?<br><br>Today the government knows nothing about number of such funds,the<br>size of their assets or the number of employees under these<br>schemes.Some guesswork suggests that assets in this sector could be<br>in the regionof Rs.1,00,000 crore, or roughly half the size of the<br>Indian mutual fundindustry. Every year companies get income tax<br>exemptions if they say thatthe PF investments they are making follow<br>the investment guidelines laiddown by CBDT. But since this is done at<br>the level of regional income taxoffices, there is no central database<br>that keeps this information in oneplace.<br><br>Worse, these PF schemes are completely unregulated. What sortof<br>benefits are they offering? Are the interests of the subscribersbeing<br>looked after? There is no way to check that there is no fraud or<br>malpracticein the running of the schemes. What if there is a default?<br>In the absenceof a database and a regulator, there is no option for a<br>subscriber but togo to court in case he is cheated. And, it may be<br>decades before he getsjustice.<br><br>There is clearly a good reason to remedy this situation.However, what<br>the Finance Bill 2006 has proposed is a giant step in thewrong<br>direction. It has proposed that unless an excluded fund isrecognised<br>by the EPFO, it will not be recognised by the income tax<br>department.This means either some companies will not take tax breaks,<br>which isunlikely, or they will rush to get recognition by the EPFO.<br><br>It isdifficult to believe that the Finance Minister is serious about<br>thisproposal. EPFO is not a regulator: it simply lacks the capacity<br>to performregulatory functions for excluded funds. After the public<br>differencesbetween the high interest rates on EPF demanded by trade<br>unions and theFinance Minister who has, correctly, been unwilling to<br>give a subsidy tothe EPFO, it is odd to see this leap of faith in the<br>EPFO.<br><br>Whileit is not entirely clear from the wording of the Finance Bill<br>that it seeksto equate the status of the excluded PFs which will be<br>'recognised' by theEPFO to that of the presently 'exempt' funds, if<br>it does, then it impliesthree things. First, the EPFO will have to<br>regulate all these funds whichit does not have the capacity, and we<br>even don't know how many funds thereare. Second, these funds will<br>have to pay interest rates that match thepolitically decided EPF<br>interest rate which could well push them intobankruptcy. And third,<br>that if a company defaults, the PF payment will be aheadache of the<br>EPFO. Since no one knows how large is the size of theproblem, this<br>could open up a can of worms bigger than the EPFO can handle.EPFO has<br>probably not been consulted before putting this administrativeand<br>financial burden upon it! With a deficit of Rs.22,000 crores inits<br>pension scheme (EPS) and with barely 25 percent of its accounts in<br>propershape, the Finance Minister ought to have serious doubts about<br>the EPFO'scapacity to handle the implications of the proposal in the<br>FinanceBill.<br><br>On the other hand, this could be an omission in the Finance Billand<br>would get corrected before the bill is passed. The best way to go<br>aheadmight be first merely to ask the companies running exempt funds<br>to registerwith the Ministry of Finance. They should be asked to<br>provide basicinformation about the number of employees covered, size<br>of assets and thenature of scheme before being eligible for income<br>tax deductions. This willgive the government a sense of the scale of<br>the problem. Next comes thequestion of how to regulate these<br>schemes. This question can be tackled byPFRDA. However, at this stage<br>even a registration will be a big step aheadand provide valuable<br>information before a policy decision is made. If theFM does not<br>correct this omission it may prove to be a very costly one forthe<br>EPFO.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div><HR><p><a href="../index.html">Back up to <i>Ila Patnaik's media page</i></a></p></body></html>
