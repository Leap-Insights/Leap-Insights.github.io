<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Arjun should focus on 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian Express, May 16, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Human Resource Minister would do a
lot better for backward castes,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">minorities, the poor and every other
underpriviledged section of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian society, if instead of focussing
on reservations, he focussed</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on the quality of the teaching the
government is imparting to young</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children. Owing to the lack of focus on
the quality of teaching, it is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">not clear that the &quot;flagship
scheme&quot; for education, the Sarva Shiksha</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Abhiyan, is leading to children getting
educated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Expenditure on the Sarva Shiksha
Abhiyan has grown dramatically</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from zero in 2001 to Rs.10,000 crore in
the latest budget. The claim</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that SSA has transformed Indian
education rests on evidence that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">enrollment has gone up. Enrollment
rates have gone up from 80% to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">nearly 100%. For most people, there is
a sense of relief that finally</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">all children are going to school. This
generates a willingness to sign</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">big cheques for SSA and to pay the
education cess that funds these</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">cheques.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, enrollment could be driven
purely by the attraction of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">midday meal. A program that gives out
free meals to children is a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">noble cause, but enrollment is clearly
not enough. Reports about many</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government schools reveal distressing
pictures of teachers cooking and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children of various ages having a meal,
but barely any quality</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">teaching going on. To avoid wasting
time on cooking, sometimes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">students are given weekly rations. This
can create a gap between</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">enrollment and attendence. The Annual
Status of Education Report</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(ASER) by Pratham shows that in Bihar
only 52 percent of the enrolled</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">students were found to be attending
schools. In Rajasthan, UP, West</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa and Madhya
Pradesh this figure was between</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">60 to 70 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of third party studies reveal
a grim picture of how much</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children learn. This raises doubts
about the effectiveness of SSA</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">beyond enrollment numbers. The ASER
study, for example, shows that 44</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent of children in public schools
in Std II to V cannot read</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">simple paragraphs. Nearly 54 percent
children cannot do two-digit</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">subraction problems. Among older
childen, 40 percent of the children</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in public schools in Std VI to VIII are
unable to handle simple</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">division problems.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This evidence should raise fresh
concerns about the extent to which</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SSA is successful at providing
education. A few weeks ago there were</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">full page advertisements in national
dailies about the success of SSA</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in terms of enrollment, number of
schools, teachers etc. Let us not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">forget that these, including
enrollment, are inputs into the process of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">education, they are not outcomes. No
evidence was provided about more</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children being able to read, write or
do math as a result. It is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">misleading to imply that something is
doing well because it uses up</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">more inputs. A steel company does not
boast about its performance by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">announcing that it used more power and
iron ore. It boasts about the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">steel produced. Moreover, it boasts
about its profits by producing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">more steel at lower costs. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet, in the case of SSA the Ministry of
Human Resources advertises</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that it spent more. More inputs went
into the process of education. It</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">kept quiet about the results. Is SSA
only meant to herd poor children</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">into school buildings by offering them
food so that claims about</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">enrollment figures can be made? An
intriguing question is why has no</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">assessment of SSA been made in terms of
the education it has provided?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why are there no standardised tests run
in schools that are receiving</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">money from the government? Why is no
one saying what SSA has achieved</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in terms of what children are learning?
Who is afraid of what an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">assessment of SSA will show?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another startling fact that the
government chooses to keep quiet about</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is the extent to which children are
moving away from public</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">schools. After all, the SSA is only
focused on government schools. SSA</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is jocularly called &quot;Sarkari
Shiksha Abhiyan&quot;.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a recent paper titled 'Private
schools serving the poor'</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">James Tooley and Pauline Dixon of the
University of Newcastle Upon</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tyne, new evidence has come to light.
This study involved 20</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">researchers combing 20 square
kilometres of slums in North Shahdara</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(East Delhi).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They report that only 71 out of the 265
schools they found were</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government schools. There were 19
private &quot;aided&quot; schools, 102 private</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;recognised&quot; schools and 73
private &quot;unrecognised&quot; schools. However,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SSA only worries about the 71 public
schools.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why are people rejecting government
schools? Part of the problem might</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">be a greater responsiveness to what
parents want. Only 2 out of the 71</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">public schools were English-medium, and
57 were exclusively Hindi. But</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">parents want their children to learn
English. Amongst private schools,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">only 55 out of 194 schools were
exclusively Hindi.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tooley &amp; Dixon ran standardised
tests on 3,495 children, thus</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">obtaining data for 24 children per
school on average.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Mathematics, the average score in
public schools was 24.5 out of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">100. Children in private schools
averaged above 40.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In languages, the average score in
public schools was 14 (English) and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">27 (Hindi). The score in private
schools was about 50.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This situation full of irony. The
government is sending Rs.10,000</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">crore into public schools through the
SSA program. But to a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">significant extent, parents are voting
with their feet, paying their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">own money, and sending their children
to private schools, where their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children obtain superior test scores.
The fees paid by parents range</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from Rs.150 to Rs.600 per month.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the states of Uttaranchal, Kerala,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,
Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">more than 45% of urban children are now
in private schools. This is an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">astonishing scale of de-facto
privatisation of elementary</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">education. In these states, the role of
private schools exceeds the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">level of utilisation of private schools
found in what is officially</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the &quot;fully privatised&quot;
education system of Chile.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maybe, students would be better off if
the government restricted</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">itself to a system for producing and
delivering free meals to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">children. The money spent on SSA would
be better spent if the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government paid parents Rs.300 per
month, and leave them to choose a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">school for their children.
