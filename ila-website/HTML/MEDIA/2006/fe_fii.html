<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The destabilising foreign hand</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Financial Express, June 6, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Are Indian equity markets driven by
FIIs? What is the share of FII</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ownership in Indian companies? How to
FII's choose which company to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">invest in, and whether to stay invested
in the company or leave? If we</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">are to understand, rather than fear,
what Indian pink papers often</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">call &quot;an FII driven market&quot;
we need to start with the facts. This was</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the objective of a recent study
(http://tinyurl.com/o8nk3), Ajay Shah</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and I did using data for all companies
listed on BSE or NSE.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We found that evidence contradicts some
widely held beliefs. For</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">example, it is believed that FIIs
&quot;dominate&quot; the equity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">market. However, the data suggests that
their role is fairly</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">limited. Price formation today
primarily takes place on the equity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">derivatives market. The latest data
shows that all institutional</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investors - domestic plus FII - add up
to roughly 8 percent of the turnover on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the equity derivatives market. To
attribute domination to something</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">smaller than 8 percent would be like
asking the tail to wag the dog. On the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">equity spot market also, the share of
FIIs in trading works out to a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">value like 8 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a more rigourous econometic analysis
examining causality, we</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">analyse daily data for net FIIs flows.
Interestingly, we do not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">find a clear causality where higher net
FII flows lead to higher stock</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">prices, or vice versa. If anything, our
analysis suggests a reverse</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">causality: that when Indian stock
prices do well, FII inflows come in;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">when Indian stock prices do badly, FII
outflows take place. Our</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">evidence suggests that atleast so far,
FIIs are followers, not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">leaders. This may well change in the
future, if FII participation on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the equity market goes from 8 percent
to (say) 50 percent. But until then, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">widespread belief about the
&quot;domination&quot; of FIIs needs to be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">questioned.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This result is supported by annecdotal
evidence. As an example, in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the latest two weeks of a sharp drop in
stock prices, the exit by FIIs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">has been remarkably small. FIIs have
been buying on the equity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">derivatives and selling on the spot. If
we add up, the total net sale</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by FIIs works out to an average of
roughly Rs.500 crore per day. This</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is a small value considering that on
most days, the total volume (NSE</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">plus BSE, spot plus derivatives) works
out to roughly Rs.50,000 crore</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">per day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How big is the share of FIIs in the
ownership of individual firms?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here we find that FII ownership is
concentrated in a small number of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">firms. In March 2005, there were only
332 companies where FII</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ownership exceeded 5 percent. This is a
tiny fraction of the 2600 companies</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in India where a meaningful extent of
equity market trading takes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">place. In total FIIs own 11 percent of
all companies. Their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">share has risen from 8.5 percent in
2001 to 11.1 percent in 2005. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, it is felt that FIIs are
capricious and unpredictable. It</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is felt that hedge funds weave from one
company to another, making</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">huge money driving up stock prices, and
damaging the cost of capital</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">when they choose to dump a company.
What does the evidence say?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While there are only 332 companies with
FII ownership exceeding 5</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent, these companies appear to have
been selected for some</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">characteristics. FIIs seem to care
about 3 things: size, liquidity and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">corporate governance. In other words,
if a company wants to attract</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foreign shareholders, it needs to be
big, it needs a liquid secondary</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">market for the stock, and the managers
need to be very careful to not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">steal from the shareholders. Once
companies achieve FII investment,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this tends to stay. There is an 82
percent chance that a company with</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">over 5 percent FII investment will
continue to have this, after a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">period of one year. This makes FIIs
looks more like a stable source of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">equity capital than a capricious and
unreliable bunch.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is easy to be xenophobic about FIIs
and slip into the stance of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mahathir Mohammad, where white men are
seen as another East India</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Company. But it makes more sense for us
to understand the rules of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">game and the forces at work in
globalisation, and then set about</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">putting our house in order so as to
exploit the benefits.</P>
