<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Prime Minister's visit to Vidarbha
district in Maharashtra to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">unveil a relief package to address
farmer distress highlights the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">importance the problem of farmer
suicides has acquired in recent</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">times. Maharashtra has seen a four fold
increase in farmer suicides in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">less than ten years. The number has
risen from 1,083 in 1995 to 4,147</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in 2004. Even though all India data
does not indicate the intensity of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the problem, more detailed data reveals
that in some districts in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">country there has been a sharp increase
in farmer suicides. A two</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pronged approach needs to be followed
to address the problem. First,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">there must be measures that address the
specific problems faced by the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">region. Second, there must be a change
in agricultural policies at a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">broader level. While the government may
find it easy to dish out</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">relief packages, the really difficult
job is to address wider policy</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">issues and to divert central government
spending on agriculture from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">food subsidy to public investment in
irrigation and rural</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">infrastructure. Having addressed the
proximate causes, it is to this</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that the Prime Minister must now turn
if he wants to prevent more</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">farmers from killing themselves.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some people like to brush the problem
of farmer suicides aside as a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hype by newspapers like the Indian
Express and local newspapers who</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have highlighted the issue. At first
blush it may appear that they are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">right. For every hundred urban Indian
men who commits a suicide, there</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">are merely 103 rural Indian men who
commit suicide. This figure</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">relates to data for 2001 from
Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">an annual publication of the ministry
of home affairs from which data</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on suicides is available. Anyone
looking at this number would not find</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a significant change in recent years as
suicides among both urban</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and rural males have increased. While
in 1975 9.7 men in every one</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">lakh Indian men committed suicide, by
2001 this number had risen to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">14.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But such a cursory look at the data is
a mistake. To understand the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">magnitude of the problem it is more
meaningful to look specifically at</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the suicide rate for farmers. This
number is available from 1995. A</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">paper by Srijit Mishra on suicide
mortality rates shows that while in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1995 in every one lakh farmers 9.7
farmers committed suicide, in a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">short span of six years this number had
risen to 16.2 by 2001. What is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">even more striking is how the suicide
mortality rate has risen sharply</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in some states. For Andhra Pradesh it
has risen from 13.6 to 25.6</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">over this period. For Karnataka it rose
from 33.7 to 44.5 and for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kerala from 127.6 to 161.8. The ratio
for Maharashtra has increased</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from 14.7 in 1995 to 44.1 over in 2001
and to a further 57 in 2004.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problem may not be an all India
phenomenon but, clearly, is quite</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">acute in some states. Indeed, even
within these states there are some</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">divisions where farmer suicides have
risen even more sharply. Between</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2001 and 2004 the divisions of Amravati
and Nagpur witnessed the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">highest suicide rates for males at
115.6 and 55.5 respectively. This</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">data reveals what the All India data
hides. That there is no denying</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that there are certain pockets of rural
India where there has been a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sharp increase in farmer distress.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The question of how to solve the
problem is far more complex. It is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">not easy to pin point the causes of the
suicides. Indebtedness is very</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">high on the list. 85 percent of the
farmers who committed suicide were</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">highly indebted. Most of these were
small and marginal farmers in rain</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fed areas that lack canal irrigation.
They try to grow cash crops and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">need water, seeds, fertilisers,
pesticides and credit. A number of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">microlevel studies have been done and
most of them indicate that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">primary reason for taking the loan was
for crop inputs. This is in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">contrast to the old India where loans
were taken for non-farm purposes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">like weddings. In 60 to 70 percent of
the cases the loan is taken from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a private money lender. Farmer's hopes
often get dashed when despite</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">boring wells they do not find water,
when the harvest is bad, or when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a good harvest results in low prices.
Two to three continous years of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">distress can push many farmers to
suicide.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The above are the proximate causes of
suicide. Other than addressing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the immediate causes, the government
also has to address the mistakes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in agricultural policies at a much
broader level. Productivity in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian agriculture has been falling as
a consequence of policy</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">mistakes. While there are a number of
measures like the development of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">weather derivatives and futures
markets, institutional credit and free</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">movement of agricultural goods that can
make a big difference, one of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the crucial constraint lies in the lack
of public investment in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agriculture. Since a large chunk of the
money spent on agriculture</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">gets spent on food subsidy which mainly
goes directly to surplus</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">producing cereal farmers in Harayana,
Punjab and UP, there is little</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">scope for the government to spend on
investment in irrigation in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">semi arid zones or rain fed areas where
distress levels are amongst</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the highest today.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The politcal economy of cereal farming
has produced enormous</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">distortions. In 1991 the central
government spent a total of Rs 239</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">crore on capital expenditure in
agriculture. It spent a total of Rs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">223 crore on plan expenditure on
irrigation and flood control. But it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">spent Rs 2,450 crore on food subsidy.
Over the years the situation</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">worsened. The expenditure on food
subsidy has increased ten fold. On</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">irrigation and public investment it has
barely increased. In 2005 the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">central government spent a total of Rs
176 crore on capital</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure in agriculture. It spent a
total of Rs 458 crore on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">irrigation and flood control. But it
spent Rs 25,800 crore on food</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">subsidy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Irrigation in rain fed areas is left to
private initiative. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government clearly needs to come up
with better policies for dry land</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agriculture. This cannot be done unless
there is a shift away from a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">focus on wheat and rice that dominates
government spending and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agricultural policies today. But unless
this is done the effectiveness</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of relief measures for distressed
farmers will remain limited.
