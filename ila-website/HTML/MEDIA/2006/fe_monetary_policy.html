<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dr Reddy got a lot of praise when he
did not raise rates in Credit</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Policy 2006-07.  Ironically, the credit
policy statement is full of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">indications that RBI perceives
inflationary expectations to be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">high. This view on future inflation
appears inconsistent with the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">decision to keep rates unchanged.
Saying that RBI will keep a watch on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation, and act when the need arises
will confuse the public and is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">not the best way to manage expectations
and conduct monetary policy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of us do not run models to
forecast inflation. But we believe</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">central banks do. If inflationary
expectations were actually low</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">before the credit policy announcement,
there are few who would not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have revised their opinion after
reading the policy statement. RBI has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">made a convincing case for expecting
higher inflation. The impact of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">higher world oil prices has not seen a
complete pass through to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">domestic prices in India, but it has to
happen.  There may not be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">clarity on when the inflation rate will
go up, but after reading the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">statement one comes away with the
distinct feeling that inflation</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rates are on their way up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life is not easy for central bankers.
Based on a variable that is not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">observed -- inflationary expectations
-- they have to use instruments</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">like interest rates that are known to
impact inflation after about at</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">least a year and a half. RBI has to
choose from a number of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">instruments available to it -- the Cash
Reserve Ratio, the bank rate</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and the repo rate. Moreover, it has to
use flawed measures of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation rates, whether based on WPI
or CPI, whose data is collected</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by other agencies and which do not
offer a clear picture for decision</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">making. The Government of India has
further burdened the RBI by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">imposing upon it the tasks of public
debt management, currency</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">management and banking regulation,
which often have conflicts with the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">conduct of monetary policy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, despite the difficulties, in
recent times central bankers</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have been increasingly successful in
the conduct of monetary policy by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">managing expectations.  For example,
when Alan Greenspan felt that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation in the US was rising and
interest rates should go up, he</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">made many speeches saying so and then
followed them by raising</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rates. The Bank of England has managed
expectations by setting up a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">transparent mechanism -- the Monetary
Policy Committee -- which is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">given an inflation target and which
puts up the minutes of its</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">meetings on its website. This allows
people to know why certain</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">decisions are being taken and to know
what to expect.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why is it important to manage
expectations? Primarly because the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">effectiveness of monetary policy
depends on what the private sector</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expects from it. The research on rules
vs discretion, credibility and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">time consistent policies, inflation
targeting and Taylor rule, all</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agree on one thing. That the private
sector factors in what it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">believes is the central bank's policy
and that makes all the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">difference to the impact of central
bank policies. When households and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">firms make decisions, the outcomes are
much better when interest rates</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">move as expected. The credibility of
the central bank is of utmost</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">importance. Private agents form
expectations and make decisions based</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on what rules, explicit or implicit,
they expect the central bank to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">follow. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Credit policy 2006-07 leaves Dr Reddy
with a difficult task. His</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">policy document makes it very clear
that inflationary expectations are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">high. Yet, he did not hike rates. As a
consequence, people can no</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">longer expect that if the RBI perceives
inflation to go up, it will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hike rates. Listening to the RBI for
the last few months had created</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expectations that rates would go up.
Even one hour before the policy</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">there was confusion -- half the
analysts on TV were saying rates would</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">go up, the other half were hoping they
would not. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What should be done now? The internal
decision to raise or not raise</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rates in July (or before that) should
not be left until then. Within</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the RBI it should be made now. Then, if
he is going to raise rates, Dr</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reddy should say so, and keep saying so
again and again till people</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">are sure that he will, and then come
July, he should raise them.
