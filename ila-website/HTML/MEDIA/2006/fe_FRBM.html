<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The importance of being fiscally
responsible</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/the-importance-of-being-fiscally-responsible/172922/" style="text-decorating:none" >Financial Express</a>, 1 August 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should a government spend as much as it
likes without worrying about</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the size of its deficits? Kerala's new
Finance Minister has questioned</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the principles of fiscal prudence and
expenditure control by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">states. Some economists have criticised
the constraints the Fiscal</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Responsibility Act has imposed upon the
central</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government. Considering the large
spending programmes that the CMP has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">imposed upon the UPA, it would be very
convenient for the central</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government to renege on its promises of
fiscal prudence.  But would it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">be a wise thing to do?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why not run larger and larger welfare
programmes and populist schemes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">financed by borrowing and win votes in
the bargain? Why did Parliament</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">try to restrict the deficits of the
central government, and the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelfth Finance Commission try to
restrict the deficits of the state</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">governments, when such restrictions are
clearly unpopular?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The answers are well known to every
student of economics. They lie in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the dangers posed by large fiscal
deficits: the dangers of external</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">indebtedness, inflation, large interest
payments, reduced private</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investment and bankruptcy. It is worth
reiterating them since they are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">particularly relevant today.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suppose the government finances
additional expenditures by simply</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">printing money. India has tried it in
the past, suffered high</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation and then wisely put an end to
this option. 'Deficit</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">financing', is no longer feasible. The
central government no longer</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">has the power to print money to spend.
What it can do, instead, is to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">issue bonds and borrow money from the
public and from commercial</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">banks.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the government spends more than it
collects in taxes, it creates</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">additional demand not backed by
production in the economy. This can</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">lead to the country importing more than
it is exporting, and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">therefore, running a trade deficit.
This has to be financed by capital</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflows like FDI, FII or foreign debt. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For any given domestic savings rate in
an economy, if the government</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">borrows from the public, then either
domestic investors get to borrow</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">less and investment goes down, or the
sum of borrowing by the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government plus private investors must
be met by capital inflows from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">abroad, or foreign savings. Foreign
capital inflows like FDI and FII</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">happen when the economy is doing well.
Foreign equity inflows are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">deterred when India runs large
deficits. So large deficits tend to go</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">along with large offshore borrowing by
the government or PSUs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Indian government ran large
deficits in the 1980s and ended up</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hugely indebted to foreign lenders by
1991. Now again, if we raise</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">deficits and if foreign investment is
inadequate to meet our deficits,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a balance of payment crises could build
up. Is that a risk worth</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">taking again? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the trade deficit rises, it puts
pressure on the currency to depreciate,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which makes imports more expensive, a
fiscal deficit can lead to an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increase in prices. In the current
scenario there is already a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pressure on prices from the supply
side. The upward movement in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">international commodity prices
including oil is already raising</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">domestic prices. A further rise in
inflation is not desirable. It is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">well understood that inflation hurts
the poor and the salaried</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">consumers disproportionately.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Morevoer, now private borrowers have to
compete for a smaller share of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">savings as the government pre-empts
savings, thus &quot;crowding out&quot; the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">private sector. Interest rates are
already on their way up. In</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">addition to lower investment, this time
there is an additional</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">uncertainty. India has been riding her
first retail credit boom in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">recent times. We do not have historical
evidence to tell us what will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">be the impact of higher interest rates
on consumer spending and GDP</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">High fiscal deficits also mean high
interest payments. The more the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government borrows today, the greater
are its committed interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">liabilities in the future. This reduces
the flexibility it has with</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">spending. Last year interest payments
took away two-thirds of taxes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">collected. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We are, right now, enjoying a
remarkable macroeconomic boom. A big</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">factor driving this is the rise in
investment, from 23 percent of GDP</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in 2001-02 to 30.1 percent in 2004-05.
One major factor underlying</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this was a shift in public sector
saving, from -2.0 percent to a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">postitive of 2.2 percent of GDP: giving
a 4.2 per cent of GDP gain. If</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">we get back to irresponsible fiscal
policy, then this gain will be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">squandered.</P>
