<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Financial Express, April 15, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From April 1, 2006 the FRBM Act
prohibits the RBI from participating</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in the primary debt market. Until now,
at the time of a primary</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">auction the RBI would devolve
government securitites into its own</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">account and then offload them later.
This allowed the RBI to smooth</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the interest rate on government
securities and thus in the market. Now</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">if at the time of the auction all
securities have to be sold, it could</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increase interest rate volatility in
the market.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To tide over the immediate problem of
having to sell all securities in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">an auction, on April 4, RBI issued new
guidelines for prmary dealers</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">requiring them to underwrite government
bonds. However, this is only a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">short term solution. At present, while
large-scale deficit financing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">no longer takes place, the RBI does
play a significant role in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">smoothing the primary market sale of
bonds by GOI by occasionally</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">stepping in to support bond auctions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the light of this development the
RBI Report on Currency and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finance agrees that the case for
separation of monetary policy and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">debt managment has never been as
compelling. When a central bank is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">given both responsibilities conflicts
of interest often arise between</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">monetary management and public debt
management. For example, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">monetary authority may keep interest
rates low to keep the interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">payments on public debt low.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alternatives to the current system
are either to transfer debt</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">management responsibility back to the
government or to create a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">separate debt office specifically for
this purpose. For the time being</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the RBI has created a functionally
separate Financial Markets</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Department in the RBI. However, this
leaves the debt management</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">function with the RBI and none of the
conflicts of interest issues get</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">resolved. ï¿½It is clear that it is
time for the Ministry of Finance to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">initiate the process of finding a long
term solution.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most governments issue bonds, without a
role for the central bank to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">buy bonds in the primary market. These
countries achieve this by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">having strong institutional mechanisms
in both the organisation of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">primary market issuance, and, the
liquidity of the secondary market.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">India has major weaknesses on both
these fronts. Reforms on both these</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fronts will help GOI achieve bond
issuance at lower interest rates,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and achieve the modern structure of
government bond issuance done</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">without involvement of the RBI.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many countries have a `merchant
banking' function, where an agency</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sells government bonds based on
instructions from the budget</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">division. Over and above this, there is
also a treasury function,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which consists of cash management, risk
management, and creative</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">initiatives aimed at reducing the cost
of government debt. GOI has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">left all this to the RBI. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Further, India lacks a vibrant bond
market today. There are barriers to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">participation, and many potential
participants are excluded. This</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hurts the fiscal problem of GOI in two
ways. First, if a potential</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">buyer of GOI bonds is excluded from
market participation, this</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increases the cost of funding the
deficit. Second, the lack of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">liquidity on the bond market induces a
`liquidity premium', where</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">interest rates required for GOI bonds
are driven up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The secondary market is the ultimate
force which determines outcomes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">on the primary market. A deep and
liquid secondary market is the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ultimate source of the ability of the
primary market to absorb</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fluctuations in bond issuance. From
month to month, based on the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">evolution of tax collections and
expenditure, the budget division</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">makes demands in terms of sale of
bonds. A deep and liquid market is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">required to absorb the fluctuations of
bond issuance by GOI, without</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">introducing excess volatility in
interest rates.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illiquidity of the bond market
hurts GOI in two ways. First, when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a month with relatively high bond
issuance takes place, the interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rate will shoot up, thus hurting the
cost of financing. Further, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">month to month fluctuations of interest
rates will send out a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">heightened risk perception about GOI
bonds, which will induce a risk</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">premium. Investors will require higher
interest rates to get invested</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in what is perceived as a risky
instrument. There is a need for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reforms aimed at obtaining a deep and
liquid bond market, with a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">massive scale of participation by
households and firms from all across</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the country.</P>
