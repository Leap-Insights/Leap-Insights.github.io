<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eleventh Plan Approach Paper
correctly notes that rural health</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">care in most states in India is marked
by absenteeism of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">doctors/health providers, low levels of
skills, shortage of medicines,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inadequate supervision/monitoring and
callous attitudes. There are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">neither rewards for service providers
nor punishments to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">defaulters. As a result health outcomes
in India are worse than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">bordering countries like Sri Lanka and
South East Asian countries like</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">China and Vietnam.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The failure of the health system is
leading to a visible decline in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">outomes. Immunisation rates in India
were already low by international</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">comparisons, worse than even those for
countries like Bangladesh and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cambodia. A recent report shows that
immunisation of children in India</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">declined sharply from an already low 52
percent in 1998-99 to 44.6</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent in 2002-03. The two rounds of
household surveys on the state</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of maternal and child health care,
conducted by the Reproductive and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Child Health Program of the World Bank,
show serious failures in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">public health services in India. Out of
274 districts, child</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">immunisation declined in 197 districts.
Routine polio, DPT and measles</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">declined in 191, 199 and 153 districts.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The data on antenatal care and assisted
deliveries is apalling. Though</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the pecentage of deliveries assisted by
health workers went up from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">39.6 percent in 1998-99 to 47.5 in
2002-03, the percentage of women</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">delivering in public health facilities
declined from 24 percent to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">18.5 percent. The increase took place
in deliveries in the private</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sector, where they rose steeply from
9.4 percent to 21.5 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironically, women in &quot;better
placed states&quot;, which presumably have</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">better access to public health
facilities, are using them less. In</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Andhra Pradesh, the percentage of women
delivering in public</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">institutions declined by 9.8 percent,
in Kerala by 28.9 percent, in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karnataka by 10.2 percent, in
Maharashtra by 9.1 percent and in Tamil</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nadu by 15.3 percent. Further, the
number of women who received post</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">natal care by public health workers
(ANM) through home visits within 2</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">weeks of delivery also declined from
14.1 percent to 12.7 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maternal mortality rate in India --
407 deaths per 100,000 live</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">births - compared with 56 in China and
46 in Sri Lanka. There may be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">many factors that explain the evidence
thrown up by the RCH report</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">such as literacy and empowerment of
women, but as recent studies on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the health sector in India have shown,
the biggest issue is the job</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">security of health staff, which leads
to a lack of interest in doing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">work for patients.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Plan document notes that there is a
shortage of health staff. But</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">does hiring more public sector health
workers contribute towards a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">more healthy population? A study in
Udaipur titled 'Wealth, health and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">health service in rural Rajasthan' by
Banerjee, Deaton and Duflo</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">conducted between January 2002 and
August 2003 shows high absenteeism</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by public health workers. 45 percent of
medical personnel are absent</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in subcentres and aid posts. 36 percent
are absent in the (larger)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primary Health and Community Health
Centres.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An absent nurse meant that the
subcentre had to be closed because</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">subcentres are often staffed only by a
nurse. Hence, subcentres were</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">closed 56 percent of the time during
regular hours. Subcentres were</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">open not merely infrequently, but also
unpredictably. Patients thus</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">often choose not to walk the
approximate half an hour from the average</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">village to the closest public health
centre.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The consequence is predictable. As the
Planning Commission's midterm</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">appraisal of the 10th Plan observes,
&quot;when people first seek treatment,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">an estimated 70-85 percent visit a
private sector provider for their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">health care needs&quot;. However, as
the midterm appraisal says, &quot;the poor</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">avail of the costlier services provided
by the private practitioner,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">even when they have access to
subsidised or free public health care,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">due to reasons of distance, but most
importantly, on account of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">unpredictable availability and very low
quality of health care</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">services provided by the rural public
primary health sector.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Plan Approach paper suggests that
the way out may be to empower</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panchayati Raj institutions to manage,
administer and be accountable</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">for health services in community
levels. The success of this strategy</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">may hinge on whether health workers
contintue to have permanent</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government jobs or get paid by the
health care they provide and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">patients they see.
