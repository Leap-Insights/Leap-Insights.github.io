However, despiteall its unpopularity, the FBT is unlikely<br>to be completely abolished. Thereason does not lie in the tax<br>collections from FBT, but the phenomenalrise in personal income tax<br>that has come after the imposition of the FBT.The collections, at Rs<br>66,000 crore are 20 percent higher than last years'sRs 50,000<br>crore. This increase has partly occured because companies havechanged<br>the structure of their pay packets so that a higher share ofsalaries<br>being paid is taxable income. Companies now have to pay taxes onthe<br>fringe benefits they give to employees. This makes paying part ofthe<br>CTC (Cost-to-company) as perks costly for the company. To shiftthe<br>burden of paying taxes to the employee, companies have reducedperks<br>and increased the amount of taxable income. The Finance Ministryfeels<br>vindicated in its claim that companies were giving employees perks<br>thatwere escaping the tax man and the FBT has made them ammend their<br>ways. Itis, thus, unlikely, that Mr Chidambaram is going to give up<br>the FBTstick.<br><br>The FBT, which taxes genuine business expenses along with theperks,<br>is unfair to companies especially whose genuine businessexpenses<br>entails a large component of travel or entertainment expense. Thetax<br>is a presumptive, rather than discretionary tax and does notinvolve<br>administrative costs in the form of tax officials visiting<br>sites.Unless industry can offer a better non-discretionary tax which<br>achieveswhat the FBT has achieved, it may be better off focusing its<br>attention onasking for changes in the FBT for their specific<br>industry, rather than ablanket removal of the tax, as that appears to<br>be an realistic option forBudget 2006.<br><br>But can the entire 20 percent increase in personal incometax revenues<br>be attributed to a shift in incomes towards taxable salaries?Last<br>year also saw rationalisation of personal tax structure, a reduction<br>intax rates and the rollout of the Tax Information Network<br>(TIN). Lower taxrates, and slab changes, reduced the tax revenue<br>collected from theexisting tax base. But, as predicted by the Laffer<br>curve, lower rates alsoencourage higher compliance. These changes<br>probably encouraged people tocomply, since the benefits from evasion<br>came down and the risk of gettingcaught went up. The FBT cannot,<br>therefore, be given sole credit for thehigher income tax<br>collections. One way or another, the recipe works andChidambaram is<br>unlikely to abandon it. <br><br><br>STT<br><br>The STT(Securities Transaction Tax) on buying and selling in the<br>equity marketwill hopefully not be increased under pressure from the<br>Left, but it isunlikely that the tax will go. On equity market<br>transactions between March1 and 30 November 2005, the Finance<br>Minister has already collected Rs 1700crore as STT. The STT from<br>March to May 2005 was 0.15 percent. Since Juneit has been 0.20<br>percent, paid half by the buyer and half by the seller.The large<br>trading volumes in the stock markets this year are responsiblefor the<br>high revenue. Hopefully, this tax will not go the way of other<br>transactiontaxes, like custom duties, which slowly inch their way up,<br>because of theirease of collection their ease of collection. <br><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div></body></html>
