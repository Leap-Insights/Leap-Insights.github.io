<h1>
  FDI lessons from China

<p>Continuing the focus on India and China the IMF launched two new
books on the side lines of the IMF World Bank Annual Meetings in
Singapore on Tuesday. "India goes global" discusses India's expanding
role in the global economy, and while "India and China, learning from
each other" focusses on the reforms that have worked in these
countries and what the two giants may learn from each other. </p>

<p>One of the biggest differences in the two countries has been in
attracting FDI. While China has managed to attract a huge amount of
FDI, India receives a fraction of the FDI China does. Should India
learn from the Chinese experience in how to attract large amounts of
FDI? While at first blush the answer may be yes, one needs to look
beyond the numbers. One of the reasons why China has attracted much
higher levels of FDI is that it has given special preferences to
foreign investors compared to domestic investors. India, on the
contrary, offers a level playing field to domestic investors and
consequently does not make it relatively more attractive for
foreigners to come. Morevoer, some studies have found that as a
consequence of its lop-sided policies, Chinese local companies have
not developed the way the dynamic private sector in India
has.</p> 

<p>Commenting on how India can learn from the Chinese experience
Wanda Tseng, Deputy Director, Asia Pacific Department, IMF, said that
given India's fiscal situation India cannot afford to give fiscal
incentives to foreign firms. Even if it was appropriate to do so,
which it is not. While the IMF supports liberalizing FDI in India, it
is mainly in terms of the regulatory environment that is equal for
both domestic and foreign investors, and in a transparent framework
providing the supportive infrastructure for FDI. If the SEZs create an
enclave where they can clear ports very quickly and there is a good
transport structure then India should go ahead with them "but
certainly in terms of tax incentives, this is not an area that India
needs to follow the Chinese example." </p>

<p>Steve Dunaway, also Deputy Director at the Asia Pacific Department
of the IMF, added, "The problem the Chinese are now having is of
getting rid of the incentives." Last year the Chinese wanted to unify
their corporate income tax, and they ran into considerable opposition
from the foreign-owned firms. Consequently, the Fund is very skeptical
about the use of fiscal incentives to attract FDI because they may in
the end create more problems than they solve. Equal treatment should
be given to domestic and foreign firms. This is also the stated policy
of the Chinese government now. Areas in which China can learn from
India including banking reforms. India has been able to reform its
public sector banks better than China has. </p>

<p>The papers in the book offer some lessons on the Indian
experience. This can help Chinese banks reform their internal
controls, their governance mechanisms, and probably the hardest thing
for a bank to do, particularly for a state-owned bank, how to price
risk to make loans at a proper interest rate. The stock market reforms
in India is another area one where the Chinese have gone through a
long period where the stock market in China has not done well. The
experience from India can help the Chinese regulators and Chinese
practitioners in terms of developing their market. Fiscal correction
in India and China would be a joint learning experience. Both
countires have to learn how to decentralise funding effectively and
ensure that local governments have the money to meet the health and
education requirements. </p>
