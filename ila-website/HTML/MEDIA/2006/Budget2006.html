Despite the difficulty<br>of the job, Finance Minister P.Chidambaram has managed to do both<br>reasonably well.<br><br>Chidambaram'sbudget speech has some small but firm steps towards<br>reforms. There areinnovative ideas which will deliver much more for<br>the economy in the longterm than meets the eye. But there are also <br>extravagrant NCMP programswhich are actually far more worthless than<br>is widely understood.<br><br>1.The budget estimate for the revenue deficit of 2006-07 has been set<br>at 2.1percent, while the fiscal deficit has been set at 3.8 percent,<br>bothindicating that we are on the path to fulfilling the FRBM<br>requirements.However, damage is being done by the UPA's flagship<br>schemes as there is anincrease in revenue expenditure through the big<br>spending central schemes.In 2005-06, this rose by 30.5% and in<br>2006-07, it is budgeted to rise byanother 26%. These increases take<br>the value from Rs.87,500 crore toRs.145,000 crore over two<br>years. While the government often pays lipservice to the goal of<br>spending more on capital expenditure, the overallcapital expenditure<br>has dropped from 3.6% of GDP in 2005-06 to 1.9%.<br><br>Further,the deficit numbers have been computed assuming that nominal<br>GDP will growby 12%. This breaks up to 4% inflation and 8% GDP<br>growth. While India hasbeen in a patch of rapid GDP growth, prudent<br>fiscal policy would have stuckwith an assumption of trend GDP growth,<br>which is closer to 7%.<br><spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><br>2. Progress has been made in themovement towards the Goods and<br>Services Tax (GST). The number of servicescovered by the service tax<br>has increased. By taking the service tax up to12%, the gap between<br>taxation of goods (at 16 percent) and services whichwere taxed at 10<br>percent has been reduced. Further, by removing manyexemptions in<br>excise - the tax on goods, the rate differences have beenbrought<br>down. This has been also accompanied by imposition of a CVD on<br>imports,a forerunner to a GST on imports. <br><br>The budget speech has put a date -2010 - for the launch of the Goods<br>and Services Tax. The date is perhapsdisappointingly far<br>away. However, it is good to have a concrete date, andstart putting<br>in the steps required from 2006 till 2010 in order to getreach the<br>target.<br><br><br>3. The peak customs rate has been cut, ashas been done in many<br>previous budgets, in the continued effort to movetowards ASEAN tariff<br>levels. Further, cuts have been applied to manycustoms rates on<br>important import items.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Equally important, the FM has taken on the<br>exemption rajin customs and end use exemptions and those requiring<br>certificates havebeen removed. The list of items where exemptions<br>exist runs into nearly2000. Today the importer gives the appraising<br>officer the relevantliterature and a certificate from one of the 33<br>approved certifyingagencies. These steps involve multiple contact<br>points with the government,and enormous costs of compliance, since<br>appraising officers have to getengaged in questions of both valuation<br>and end-use. Elimination ofexemptions will serve to improve<br>compliance and raise revenues. This wouldalso serve to remove the<br>involvement of agencies which certify end use. Itwill remove the<br>involvement of customs officers who can today choose whoqualifies for<br>the exemption and who does not. This reform is far biggerthan meets<br>the eye.<br><br><br>4. A new idea that has been introduced inthis year's budget is the<br>measurement of the costs of exemptions.Traditionally, exemptions were<br>a non-transparent way for a politician tofavour one pressure group. A<br>subsidy is too transparent: everyone can seewhat one pressure group<br>is grabbing. But an exemption can be tucked away inthe finance bill<br>and nobody knows how much it costs. Now, there is aneffort at listing<br>out the exemptions and attributing a price tag to each ofthem. The<br>statement shows that a total of Rs 158,661 crore of revenuewas<br>foregone by the government on account of exemptions for corporate tax,<br>personalincome tax, cooperative sector treatment, excise and customs<br>duties.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Corporate tax exemptions and customduty exemptions (after<br>adjusting for export related exemtions) and the twobig items of more<br>than Rs 57,000 crore each.<br><br>5. The structuralreforms in finance gives investors a positive<br>signal. The decisions toincrease FII limits on investment in<br>government bonds and corporate bonds,and the flexibility for mutual<br>funds to build superior products based onglobally diversified<br>portfolios, are small steps in the long process ofliberalisation of<br>the capital account. However, they have signaling value,especially to<br>the foreign investor for they depart from the enhancedcontrols on<br>capital inflows often sought by RBI. Further, there is anattempt to<br>build a corporate bond market, by having trading on exchangesand<br>regulation by SEBI. This will double the impact of the increase inthe<br>FII limit for corporate bonds.<br><br><br>6. An interest rate of 7percent for farmers, the 2 percent subsidy<br><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for farmers and an increase in defined benefitpensions of Rs 200 for<br><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>destitute pensioners are a step backwards in the move towardsmarket<br><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>determinedinterest rates and a DC pension system. <br><br><br><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div><HR><p><a href="../index.html">Back up to <i>Ila Patnaik's media page</i></a></p></body></html>
