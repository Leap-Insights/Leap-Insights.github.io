<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kerala moves towards fiscal
irresponsibility. West Bengal tries</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> The new LDF government in Kerela
presented Budget 2006-07 for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> state with a sharp rise in spending.
Revenue expenditure is budgeted</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> to increase from an average of 16.9
percent of Gross State Domestic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Product over the last ten years to
19.5 percent in the current</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> year. This will result in a sharp
increase in the revenue deficit for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> the state at Rs 5,415 crore. In
2005-06 the revenue deficit was Rs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 3,561 crores.  Having gone for a sharp
increase in expenditure on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> welfare and benefits, the Left front
Finance Minister Dr Thomas Issac</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> criticized the centre for restricting
deficits. The fiscal deficit in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Kerala in 2006-7 stands at Rs 7,534
crore, having gone up from Rs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 4,513 crores in the previous year.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> The minister said, &quot;It is when we
ask how a democratically</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> elected Government can show such an
obvious anti-people attitude,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> that the role of 'Fiscal
Responsibility Legislation' imposed by the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Central Government as part of
globalization becomes very clear. Their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> commitment is not towards people who
elected them but to certain</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> targets fixed by experts who framed
the fiscal responsibility laws,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> which are then enacted by some State
Governments, knowingly or</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> unknowingly. This is truly
anti-democratic.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;The Centre has been thrusting
targets related to income, expenditure,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit on
states in such a way that it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> would be applicable even to future
Governments. The Finance</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Commissions have been made a tool for
this. Governments, which come</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> to power giving a lot of promises, are
forced to swallow them quoting</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The West Bengal budget presented by
Finance Minister Asim Das Gupta</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">after the CPM government was re-elected
to power shows an estimate of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a revenue deficit of Rs 8,759 crore.
The state has not been in a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">position to sign up for the Fiscal
Responsibility Legislation due to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the precarious fiscal position of the
state. The CPM government headed</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by Buddadeb Dasgupta appears to be
making some progress on getting the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">state out of the financial mess it is
in. This is not an easy task.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fical performance of West Bengal in
the nineties was amongst the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">worst in Indian states. Twelfth
Finanace Commission estimates show</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">that West Bengal ranked the worst among
all states in terms of its</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">revenue deficit in the years 2000-03
when its revenue deficit stood at</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">5.47 percent of Gross State Domestic
Product. The Commission report</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">also shows that the revenue deficit in
West Bengal worsened sharply</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from 1993-96 to 2000-03. Only next to
Gujarat where the slippage was</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the highest, it worsened by 3.95
percent of GSDP.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiscal deficit in West Bengal was
the second worst after</P>

deficit in West Bengal stood at</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">7.31 percent of GSDP. The slippage in
fiscal deficit over the period</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1993-96 to 2000-03 was the worst among
all states. It fell by 4.13</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">West Bengal has also been the worst
performer in terms of own tax</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">revenue collection. It collected 4.26
percent of GSDP as taxes. Even</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bihar collected more of its prodcuction
as taxes (at 4.46 percent of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">GDP) than West Bengal. Instead of
improving, as most states did on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this front, West Bengal saw a decline
in own tax revenue over the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">period 1993-96 to 2000-03 by 1.2
percent of GSDP.</P>
