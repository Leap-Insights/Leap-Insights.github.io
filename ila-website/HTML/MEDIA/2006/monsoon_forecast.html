<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first monsoon forecast has arrived.
It says that this year the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">monsoon is expected to be 93 percent of
the normal monsoon. Since</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">there is a margin of error of 5
percent, this means that the monsoon</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">could be normal at 98 percent, or lower
at 88 percent. Very soon, GDP</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth forecasts based on the monsoon
scenario will be produced by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">various think tanks and analysts. As
the monsoon forecast moves up and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">down, models will be run, forecasting
GDP growth rates for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">year. They will contribute to changing
expectations and moving stock</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">market indices.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But is India still as sensitive to the
monsoons as it is going to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">appear in the next few weeks? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While it is true that a bad monsoon
will immediately affect the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">incomes of farmers in unirrigated areas
(which constitute more than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">half the cultivated area) and the
poorer farmers in these areas will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">suffer a drop in consumption, the
impact of the monsoon on the Indian</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">economy as a whole is no longer as
strong as it used to be. When GDP</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">forecasts based on the &quot;normal&quot;
or otherwise monsoon scenario come</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">out, and before we start panicking, we
should not forget that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian economy has undergone rapid
structural change in the last 15</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">years. The share of agriculture in the
Indian economy is rapidly</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">shrinking as it did in all advanced
economies. Agriculture's share in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">GDP in 1991 was 33 percent. By 2000 it
had fallen to 25 percent. Now</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">it is down to 21 percent of GDP.
Looking forward, we can expect it to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fall further.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in general, the models that
are used to estimate the impact</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of the monsoon on GDP are backward
looking, as are all</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">macroeconometric models. Usually the
elasticities that have been</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">estimated reflect the reponse of the
economy to the monsoon over an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">average of the last 30 years. This
tends to overstate the impact of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the monsoon on non-agricultural growth
and on overall GDP growth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The direct impact of the lower share of
the monsoon is that as</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agriculture constitutes about 20
percent of GDP, a one percentage</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">point decline in agricultural
production directly translates into only</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a 0.2 percentage point decline in GDP
growth. This by itself makes a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">big difference. What makes an even
bigger difference is the change in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the linkages between the agricultural
and non-agricultural sectors.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An important change that has
accompanied the decline in the share of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agricuture is the growth of foreign
trade. This has reduced the impact</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of agricultural performance on
non-agricultural sectors. The linkages</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">between agriculture and GDP arise from
both the demand and the supply</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">side. On the demand side, when
agricuture does well, rural incomes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rise. A rise in rural incomes leads to
greater demand for industrial</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">products. It has been seen that
consumer goods do well when rural</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">incomes rise. In some cases the impact
is immediate, in others it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">comes with a lag. So, for example, the
sales of shampoos, soap and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">bicycles might respond immediately,
whereas the sales of motorcycles,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fertiliser, tractors and TVs may have a
lagged impact. The sharp</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">increase in the share of manufactured
goods that are exported in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">last fifteen years have made
manufacturing far more resilient to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the ups and downs in demand associated
with changes in farm incomes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the supply side, increase in
agricultural production increases the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">supply of food and raw materials.
Cereals, fruit, vegetables, milk,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">meat, eggs etc. enter the consumption
bundle of households. Their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">plentiful supply and lower prices,
following a good monsoon, reduces</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the cost of living. Real incomes of
both the urban and rural</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">populations increase. They both have
more to spend on non-agricultural</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">products. Also, there are a large
number of industries that use farm</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">products as raw materials. Products
such as sugarcane, cotton and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">oilseeds are directly used by industry.
Cleaper raw materials augur</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">well for these industries. Again, the
liberalisation of the external</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sector, greater options to import and
the availability of resources to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">do so, has reduced the dependence of
manufacturing on agriculture.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Futher, many non-agricultural
businesses may not do well when there is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a bad monsoon and a fall in farm
income. But today even the impact on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">their consumption is not as sharp as it
used to be. Higher financial</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">savings and physical assets as well as
acccess to credit allows</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">households, especially in urban areas,
to smooth consumption and not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">add to the shrinkage in demand when
there is a bad monsoon and their</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">profits decline.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the period before the 1990s, a drop
in agricultural growth rates</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">were accompanied by a sharp drop in
non-agricultural</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth. Manufacturing and services grow
slowly not only in that year,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">but even beyond that year into the
first few months of the next</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">year. This has changed. The last time
when GDP saw an actual decline</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">was in 1979-80 a result of a very bad
monsoon when agricultural output</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fell by a shocking 13 percent, and an
oil price shock shook the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">world. Nor surprisingly, industrial
growth declined by over 3 percent,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and GDP fell by 5.2 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in the 1990s when agricultural
output declined, though industrial</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth slowed down, industrial
production did not fall. Even when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agricultural output fell by 7 percent
in 2002-03 (a very bad monsoon),</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">industrial growth remained positive at
6.6 percent and services at 8</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">percent. Overall GDP grew at 4 percent.
Last year (2004-05) when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">agriculture grew at 1.15 percent, GDP
grew at 7 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In summary, while the monsoons are
important, especially for farm</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">incomes and for certain industries, the
impact of the monsoons on the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">overall Indian economy is often
overstated. Today the Indian economy</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is far more resilient to the monsoons
than it ever was.</P>
