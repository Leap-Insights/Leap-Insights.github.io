<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking for a better consumer price
index</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Financial Express, June 20, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many media reports claim that consumers
perceive inflation in excess</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of the reported 4.7 per cent. This
questions the integrity of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government statistics. In a remarkable
recent episode, trade unions</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have objected to the ILO that workers
mistrust the revised CPI for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Industrial Workers (base year = 2001).
Steps much be urgently taken to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">create a trasnparent weekly CPI that is
released with a lag of no</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">worse than a fortnight.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Currently, for watching inflation in
India we have the choice of using</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the CPI or the WPI. The pros and cons
of the two are as follows.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Frequency: The WPI is released weekly,
while the CPI is monthly. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Delays: As an example, as of today (17
June), the most recent</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">available WPI pertains to June 3, 2006
but the most recent available</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CPI pertains to April 2006.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Choice of commodities and weights: The
WPI reflects neither producer</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">prices nor consumer prices. It suffers
from questionable choice of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commodities and weights. Adequate care
has not been taken in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">accurately defining the grade and
physical specifications of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commodities. The CPI has a
fundamentally superior methodological</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foundation, for a household survey is
utilised to find out the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">consumption of a &quot;typical&quot;
household, and this drives the choice of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commodities and weights.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transparency: Data about the series
going into the WPI is released</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">into the public domain. The CPI is much
more non-transparent. When the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government releases a GDP number,
households do not feel they have an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">independent view about GDP. But when it
comes to inflation, everyone</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">who shops has a view about the &quot;true&quot;
inflation. The non-transparency</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of CPI has encouraged mistrust of the
CPI and conspiracy theories</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">about manipulation of data by the
government.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So while the CPI fundamentally makes
more sense than the WPI, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">usefulness of the CPI has been
radically undermined owing to low</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">frequency, high delays and
non-transparency. As a consequence, the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;headline inflation number&quot;,
which is widely followed in the press,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">has become the WPI.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A major achievement of macro policy in
India in the last decade has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">been a decline of inflation to sub-5%
levels. A healthy feature of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian politics is that there is an
uproar when inflation goes up;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">this acts as a check against a
government that might seek to impose an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation tax upon bondholders.
However, inflation in India remains at</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">very high rates by world standards,
where well run central banks</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">target inflation rates like 2 to 2.5%.
India's finishing stretch, in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">going from inflation of roughly 4% to
roughly 2-2.5%, strongly</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">requires better measurement of
inflation, for we would now be dealing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">with small and subtle changes in
inflation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A committee headed by Planning
Commission member Abhijit Sen has been</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">given the task of constructing a
Producer Price Index (PPI) for</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">India. However, it is equally important
to transform the CPI. The CPI</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">needs to shift to a weekly frequency,
with a lag of no greater than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">one fortnight. It needs a top quality
methodological foundation in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">terms of a household survey which is no
more than 3 years old, where</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the full survey database is released
into the public domain, so that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">there are no accusations about fudging
weights or</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commodities. Finally, every piece of
price information that goes into</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the CPI needs to be released into the
public domain. This needs to be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">done for historical data also, so as to
enable innovative applications</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of this information, and improve the
trustworthiness of the CPI.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once inflation measurement is improved,
two major developments can</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">take place.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first is the issuance of inflation
indexed bonds. Perhaps a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">quarter of the bond issuance of the GOI
needs to be shifted to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation indexed bonds. The reason for
this is two-fold. First,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">households who seek to plan for old age
without uncertainty about</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation should be able to do so.
Second, the secondary market</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">trading of inflation-indexed bonds
reveals the market's perception</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">about expected inflation, a key
ingredient that goes into monetary</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">policy formulation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second major development would be a
much more modern monetary</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">policy that explicitly links up
developments on inflation to the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">short-term interest rate setting of the
central banks. At present, it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is impossible for RBI to be
particularly scientific about monetary</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">policy, for the foundation of that
(inflation) is not properly</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">measured.</P>
