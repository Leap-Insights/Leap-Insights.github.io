<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bad Economic Zones</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian Express, June 24, 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the 25,000 acre SEZ in Haryana
taking shape, and with Maharashtra</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">setting the pace with reforms to labour
law in SEZs, India seems to be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">effectively moving forward on the
agenda of creating Special Economic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zones. On one hand, an effective SEZ
policy could bolster India's</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">growth, by making a dent on urban
infrastructure and labour</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">reforms. It could, as a consequence,
have big payoffs in terms of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employment and GDP growth. But
unfortunately, at the same time, SEZs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">add to a sombre picture of a second
phase of a fiscal crisis. With</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">great difficulty, India has clawed back
from a fiscal disaster over</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the last six years. But early signs
suggest that we could slip back to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a fiscal disaster by 2010. Proposed
expenditures are large while</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">revenue collections could shrink.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the first few months of forming the
government, the UPA gave out a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">very strong message that it believed in
fiscal consolidation. Finance</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Minister P. Chidambaram went ahead and
implemented the Fiscal</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Responsibility and Budgetary Management
(FRBM) Act that had been begun</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by the previous government. A signal
was given to the world that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">despite the support of the Left, the
government was not going to run</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">large deficits and fiscal reform will
be on track.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been feared that the support of
the Left would make the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government take up socialist welfare
measures. But reality has turned</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">out to be quite different. The Congress
Party, and not the left, has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">turned out to be the biggest enemy of
the fiscal responsibility</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">act. Indeed, the Left's contribution
is, if anything, positive. The</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">West Bengal Finance Minister has pushed
the state VAT forward, paving</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the way towards a national level GST.
Despite all the talk by Left</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">intellectuals about financing deficits
by printing money, at the end</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of the day, they hvae merely supported
continuing old programmes like</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the PDS and subsidies for LPG, not
pushing big new ones.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Congress, on the other hand, with
complete disregard to the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">promises it has made on fiscal
responsibility, has moved towards large</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">scale spending programmes such as the
National Rural Employment</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guarantee Act (NREGA), pumped up the
money going into Sarva Shiksha</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ahiyan (SSA), initiated the sixth pay
commission, and possibly a raft</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of welfare provisions including defined
benefit pension for the 400</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">million unorganised sector workers.
When implemented, these programmes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in a few years, could lead up to
additional spending of well over Rs 1</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">lakh crore. In addition to these
spending programmes, there is the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">populist oil price policy which could
ultimately hit the budget when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">oil PSU's cannot run losses any more.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And, if that was not enough, the UPA
has initiated hundreds of SEZs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">all over the country, with the most
generous tax concessions</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">imaginable. The SEZs could cost the
exchequer about Rs 95,000 crore</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">over the next few years. This year the
budgeted fiscal deficit has</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">been brought down to 3.7 percent of
GDP. Despite the finance</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commission adding to the centre's
deficit by raising the share of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">revenues going to the states, the FRBM
was not thrown completely</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">off-track. The expansion of the service
tax net and increase in rates,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">improvement in tax administration
through TIN, and direct tax reform</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">had a positive impact. The UPA has been
lucky on GDP growth in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">past two years. High GDP and
manufacturing growth has given buoyant</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">tax collections.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But all this is before the really big
spending has started. Under the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">FRBM the government has promised a
fiscal deficit of no worse than 3%</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by 2008-09, and that too only for the
purpose of capital</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure. It, unfortunately, looks
increasingly infeasible for the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">UPA to achieve these goals. A scheme
like the NREGA is completely open</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ended. The government cannot say that
it will only spend Rs 14,000</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">crore, because by the very definition
of the scheme, it has promised</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to spend as much as there is demand for
employment. Morevoer, when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">state governments are allowed to
determine the minimum wage that the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">centre must pay, the run on expenditure
can be without limits when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">states compete with each other to pay
more than one another.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most serious threat to the FRBM
will come from the SEZs. Tax</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exemptions are being given not only to
exporters but to real estate</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">developers who are getting a fiscal
gift from the government when</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">after the government acquires land
cheap for them, it gives them a tax</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">break when they sell commercial plots
and residences (not necessarily</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to exporters) for a profit. Further,
FRBM projections were made on the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">assumption of a high tax buoyancy: An
increase in GDP would lead to a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">greater increase in tax collections.
But now companies have incentives</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to locate up new establishments only in
SEZs. Not only is the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">infrastructure going to be better, they
are going to get tax</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exemptions for profits from exports. It
will not be long before</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">companies devise ways to show more and
more income as income from SEZ</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">activities. With tax havens inside the
country, hundreds of ways will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">be found to route income such that as
little as possible tax is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">paid. If incremental GDP is booked in
SEZs, then the basic tax</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">buoyancy assumptions that underlie the
FRBM Task Force report will</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">break down. More than a hundred SEZs
all over the country are a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">finance minister's worse nightmare.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Advocates of SEZs look forward to SEZs
featuring an immunity from the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">labour law, poor tax policies and tax
administration of the Indian</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">State. The idea is that an SEZ is a
place where it becomes possible to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">merely hire globally competitive Indian
labour, without all the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">terrible impediments thrown up by the
socialist State. However, it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">will be impossible for the SEZs to
function without a giant new</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">bureaucracy springing up to plug these
leakages of tax. We will have</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">created a new problem for the next
generation of reformers to attack.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The FRBM was an act of parliament, but
when the parliament itself is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">merrily passing other acts which care
little for the promises it made,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">who will play the watchdog?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
