This year the &quot;budget buzz&quot; is<br>almost missing as no majortax reform is being expected. However,<br>there is more to the budget thanmeets the eye. The `budget' is<br>supposedly about the taxation andexpenditure of the government. But<br>over the years, the budget speech hasevolved into a much more<br>important institution. The budget speech specifiesa work plan of the<br>government for the coming year to the public. Thisfacilitates<br>decision making by weak governments, and lends itself tostructured<br>monitoring. The speech has become something far more than anarrow tax<br>and spend plan of the government for the coming year. In theframework<br>of our democracy and its coalition politics, this is awelcome<br>metamorphosis.<br><br>The constitutional role of the `FinanceBill' is well defined and<br>limited. For the government to tax citizens, orto spend, the<br>`approval of Parliament is required. This leads to thesimple<br>structure of a budget speech which introduces the Finance Bill,<br>followedby discussion in Parliament, and then a vote. In the early<br>years in India,there was little else in the budget speech.<br><br>The significance of budgetspeeches appears to have begun with<br>Manmohan Singh in the budget speech ofJuly 1991 which announced<br>India's economic reforms. On one hand, in1991-1993, the core business<br>of taxation and expenditure involved dramaticchanges, since the<br>larger process of economic reform required major changesto income<br>tax, excise, customs duties, and expenditure patterns. <br><br>Allthrough the 1990s weak prime ministers grappled with the problem<br>ofobtaining coherent policy making from a fractious bunch of<br>ministers andcoalition partners. In this context the budget speech<br>has evolved as asetting for behind-the-scenes negotiations between<br>the PM, the FM andcabinet about the major activities of the coming<br>year. It has become acommitment device whereby all ministries are<br>bound by the promises in thebudget speech.<br><br>Yashwant Sinha, when he was Finance Minister, was oftencriticised<br>when promises of the budget speech were not kept. These wouldoften be<br>tasks for which other ministries were responsible. In response,he<br>started a system of tracking the implementation of every sentenceof<br>the speech. After the speech, Finance Ministry staff were requiredto<br>strip the speech down to the hard content of every sentence, andtrack<br>the implementation of that sentence through the year. It has now<br>becomea norm to present in parliament the status of last year's<br>promises withevery budget document. When Mr. Chidambaram presents his<br>budget on 28February 2006, he will also release the report on the<br>status ofimplementation of the speech promises of 28 February 2005.<br><br>In this waythe budget speech has evolved into a workplan for<br>government for the comingyear. It performs a key role of making a<br>statement to parliament about whatthe State will do for the coming<br>year. This improves the transparency ofgovernment. Every sentence is<br>interpreted in legalistic fashion. Everyministry in government is<br>pressured to deliver on the work that waspromised in the budget<br>speech. The typical joint secretary in governmenthas a choice of<br>doing more work than was promised in the budget speech, buthe is<br>pushed to atleast deliver on the work that was promised in thebudget<br>speech.<br><br>In earlier years, budget speeches could make a markby cutting tax<br>rates. But today with much lower rates, the headroom forthis has<br>significantly subsided. A finance minister can no longer play tothe<br>gallery by lowering rates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The focus has, hence, increasingly shifted<br>to broader issues ofeconomic reform. Hence, we may expect future<br>budget speeches to focus evenmore on the broader workplan for the<br>year, and even less on taxation.<br><br>Thebudget speech often accurately describes the realm of what is<br>possiblegiven the government's political constraints. When labour<br>reformdisappeared from the NDA's budget speeches, it was understood<br>that the NDAgoverment would no longer be pursuing this agenda. Or<br>this year if a disinvestmenttarget is missing in the budget speech,<br>it will indicates that the UPAgovernment does not expect to come to<br>an agreement with the Left on theissue of disinvestment.<br><br>Budget speeches have also evolved as amechanism for keeping up many<br>kinds of appearances - often populist inessence. Finance ministers<br>probably make a mental list of MPs and try toget a sentence or two<br>that presses the buttons of everyone present in theroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Budget<br>speeches of theUPA are riddled with phrases which please the `old<br>Congress' or the CPI(M)variety socialism. Various small schemes that<br>can have little nation-widelong-term impact get announced in this<br>process. This should be seen as thecost of democracy where the cost<br>in terms of the actual spend is not verybig, but it gets the<br>government the necessary support to get the budgetpassed in<br>parliament.<br><br><br>Another element that shapes the budgetspeech in India is the pressure<br>by the media for a budget that makesprogress on economic reform. The<br>budget speech is judged by hundreds ofnewspaper and TV commentators,<br>and any finance minister would like to bepraised by them. The media<br>cares about somewhat different issues ascompared with<br>politicans. There is greater support for economic reformshere, on the<br>core issues of a small State, a greater role for the privatesector,<br>flexible markets, and globalisation. Every government seeks to sellto<br>the private sector, to domestic and foreign investors, by showing a<br>positivevision of economic reforms which will incite greater<br>investment inIndia.<br><br><br>The puzzle for the budget speech, then, consists ofcobbling together<br>consensus in cabinet on economic policy, taxationand<br>expenditure. This consensus should make it possible to promise a<br>sufficientlyexciting workplan for the coming year, so as to put out a<br>message thatIndia is making progress. Simultaneously, there have to<br>be sentences whichpander to specific constituencies and keep the<br>political base satisfied.Purists may hanker after a terse taxation<br>and expenditure speech. But thatwould be missing out the big picture<br>of the role that the budget speech hasnow come to play in Indian<br>politics and economic policy formulation. It maythe Finance Minister<br>making the speech, but it is no less than a state ofthe union address<br>with the backing of the entire cabinet and the primeminister behind<br>it. <br><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div><HR><p><a href="../index.html">Back up to <i>Ila Patnaik's media page</i></a></p></body></html>
