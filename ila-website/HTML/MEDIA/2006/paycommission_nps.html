<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the Cabinet gave its approval to
the terms of reference of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sixth Pay Commission to review salaries
and pension benefits,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government employees all over the
country will have something to cheer</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">about. What is perhaps not appreciated
is the extent to which they</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">have the new structure of pensions in
government to thank for in the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">willingness of the government to go
ahead with the pay commission and in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">what may likely be decent salary
improvements. Thanks to the move from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a defined benefit to a defined
contribution system under the new</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pension scheme, the financial burden of
another pay commission is a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">little less daunting than that of
previous pay commissions. It is partly on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">account of this that despite the large
deficits and enormous welfare</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">spending programmes of the UPA, the
government may be able to provide</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government employees a fair deal. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the recommendations of the fifth
pay commission were implemented</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the impact on central government
finances was estimated to be Rs 3,500</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">crore per year. The expenditure impact
for all state governments taken</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">together was about 1.5 times that for
the centre. The total increase</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in expenditure on salaries and pensions
of the employees of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Central Government, State governments
and autonomous bodies has been</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">estimated to be to the tune of Rs
14,000 crore.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiscal impact of the sixth pay
commission could be upto 25,000</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">crore. However, while the pay
commission would review salaries and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pensions of all exising government
employees, one chunk that would be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">out of it would be central government
employees who have joined</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">service after January 1, 2004 and are
now part of the defined</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">contribution New Pension Scheme. Their
pension benefits are not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;defined benefits&quot; and will
not be fixed by the pay commission. Under</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the NPS every employee contributes 10
percent of his salary and DA. A</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">matching contribution is made by the
government. In the context of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sixth pay commission this means that
the total financial burden of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government obligations for pensions
revisions by the sixth pay</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commission will be limited to the older
employees of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government. By 2010 when the pay
commission recommendations may be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">implemented there would be
approximately 1 million employees who are in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the defined contribution system and no
longer pose a financial burden</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to the government. Considering the
finacial constraints every</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">goverment faces, and this government
faces more than any other, this</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">important fact will allow a greater
scope for salary improvement than</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">if their pension burden had to be borne
by the government.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The benefits of the adopting the new
pension scheme will accrue not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">only to the centre but also to the 16
states who have joined the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">NPS. The exising burden of pensions on
state finances is already very</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">high. Uttar Pradesh spent Rs.4143.3
crore in 2004-05 as pension</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">payments. This constituted 75 percent
of its revenue deficit. Andhra</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pradesh spent Rs.3071 crore.
Maharashtra spent Rs.2731 crore, while</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">West Bengal spent Rs.2914 crore. In
terms of the net present value of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">future payments, the two states with
the biggest problem on pensions</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">are Maharashtra and West Bengal.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All states taken together paid
Rs.39,370 crore as pension</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">payments. The burden of payments grew
sharply in 1993 to 2003 at the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">rate of 23 percent, faster than the
rate of growth of total revenues,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">own revenues and total expenditures.
Pension payments to state</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">employees have been eating
significantly into state developmental</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure which declined from 68
percent to 54 percent of total</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">state expenditure in the last twenty
years, as pension payments rose</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">from 5 percent to 9 percent.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When pension liablities in Andhra
Pradesh rose manyfold from Rs 330</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">crore in 1990-91 to Rs.2321 crore in
2001-02, it chose to join the new</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pension system.  Himachal Pradesh
issued orders for new recruits being</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">part of the NPS in March 2003 and Tamil
Nadu in May 2003, even before</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the Central government did so in August
2003.  Chhattisgarh joined on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">November 1, 2004, Jharkhand on December
1, 2004, Manipur on January 1,</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All other states, with the exception of
West Bengal which has taken an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">explicit decision not to join, are
considering joining the new scheme.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These states will now reap the benefits
of having joined the new</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">scheme. They already have significant
number of employees who are in</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the new system. Rajasthan today has
37,000 new recruits of the state</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government are now members of the New
Pension Scheme. The Rajasthan</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government had announced it would join
the the NPS of the Government</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of India on Jan 1, 2004. Maharashtra
has about 24,000 new employees</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">who are in the NPS. Tamil Nadu has
10,670 employees in the scheme. New</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">entrants like Goa have 1,162 state
government employees and a hundred</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">school teachers in the NPS, while
Madhya Pradesh has 2108, Orissa 260,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gujarat 250 and Uttaranchal 500. It is
estimated that there are a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">total of 500,000 employees of the
central and state governments and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">autonomous bodies who are already
members of the NPS.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Left, primarily for ideological
reasons, has been trying to stall</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the NPS and push for all government
employees being put back into a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">defined benefit system. Not only will
this mean that the new recruits</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of the NPS will lose out on the
benefits and improved pensions they</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">would have been able to get under the
new system, considering the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pension obligations that this will
involve for them, it will impose</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">greater constraints on the pay
commission when considering</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">improvements in government salaries. In
the best interests of</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government employees, it may be hoped
that the Left will not succeed.</P>
