<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">High risks in high deficts</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indian Express, 27 July 2006</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Consumer prices in June 2006 were 6.5
percent higher than in June</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2005. Last year in June price rise over
the previous year was less</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">than 4 percent. The government has
tried to combat the sharp increase</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">in inflation by a combination of supply
side measures and higher</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">interest rates. Undoubtedly, the impact
of these steps is more direct</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">and visible, while that of fiscal
policy is not. But when the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government is trying to restrict
private expenditure by raising</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">interest rates, is there not a case for
it to restrict public</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expenditure too?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironically, what we find is that even
in these taxing times when there</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">is acute pressure on prices to rise,
arguments are being made to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">abandon even the legitimate restraint
that Parliament places on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government through the Fiscal
Responsibility and Budgetary Managment</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(FRBM) Act.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Considering that inflation is only one
of the dangers of large fiscal</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">deficits, where external indebtedness,
inflation, large interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">payments, reduced private investment
and debt default are some of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">others, this is a very unwise argument.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One option is that the government
finances additional expenditures by</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">simply printing money. India has tried
it in the past, suffered high</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflation and then wisely put an end to
this option. The central</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">government no longer has the power to
print money to spend. What it</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">can do, instead, is to borrow money
from the public and from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">commercial banks.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if the government's deficit exceeds
the amount the domestic</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">private sector lends to it, the country
as a whole now spends more</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">than it produces. It imports more than
it exports. The additional</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">spending has to be financed by capital
inflows like FDI, FII or</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foreign debt. For any given domestic
savings rate in an economy, if</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the government borrows from the public,
then either domestic investors</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">get to borrow less and investment goes
down, or the sum of borrowing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">by the government plus private
investors must be met by capital</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflows from abroad, or foreign
savings. Foreign capital inflows like</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">FDI and FII happen when the economy is
doing well. Foreign equity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">inflows are deterred when India runs
large deficits. So large deficits</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">tend to go along with large offshore
borrowing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Indian government ran large
deficits in the 1980s and ended up</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hugely indebted to foreign lenders by
1991. Now again, if we raise</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">deficits and if foreign investment is
inadequate to meet our deficits,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foreign debt could build up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Morevoer, the goverment often gets
preferential treatment as a</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">borrower both from public sector banks
and from those with a lower</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">risk appetite. Private borrowers have
to compete for a smaller share</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of savings as the government pre-empts
savings. It thus &quot;crowds out&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the private sector by pushing up
interest rates and reducing private</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">investment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Further, high fiscal deficits mean high
public interest</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">liabilities. The more the government
borrows today, the greater are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">its committed interest liabilities in
the future. This reduces the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">flexibility it has with spending. Last
year interest payments took</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">away two-thirds of taxes collected. If
the state of public services is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">poor today, then the blame partly lies
on the fiscal profligacy of the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">previous governments. If the state of
infrastructure is poor, if roads</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">are badly maintained, if the government
has not had the money to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">invest in new airports, ports or power
plants, the problem is not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">unrelated to the size of past deficits.
If we run higher deficits</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">today we are tying down the hands of
future governments who will end</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">up using all their tax collections to
pay for our expenditure today.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the government continues to run
deficits and borrows more and more,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">there comes a time when the government
is borrowing only to repay its</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">debt. It starts running a &quot;Ponzi
scheme&quot; named after the innovative Mr</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ponzi who ran a nice little racket,
borrowing from B to pay A and from</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C to pay B and so on. As the size of
the debt increases this could</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">lead to a situation in which the
government thinks it is better to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">default on its debt. In India we have
not yet worried about the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">possibility of default, but the current
level of the public debt is</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">very high by world standards. As it
rises further, there would be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fears about the government defaulting
on its debt obligations. Not</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">only will millions of households lose
their savings in post-offices,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">National Saving Scheme, PPF, GPF and
RBI bonds, the banking system</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">which holds about 85 percent of
government debt will lose</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">heavily. This would hurt millions of
households across the country.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is very easy today for the
government to spend crores of rupees on</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">welfare schemes financed by deficits.
The voter is unable to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">comprehend that he is paying for them
through higher prices. Yet,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">while doling out borrowed money to win
votes might seem to be an</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">attractive option, it should be
remembered that the inflation</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">tolerance of the Indian consumer is
low, and the end of the day high</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">deficits may prove to be very costly.</P>
