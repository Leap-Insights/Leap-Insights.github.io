Until now, the prime focus of education<br>policy hasbeen the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), which attempts to<br>ensure that allchildren in India attend primary school. Improvements<br>in primary educationare creating increased demand for secondary<br>education. The next step is,then, to find ways to take children<br>beyond Class V by creating adequatecapacity in secondary schools.<br><br><br>It has been reported that 25percent of the education cess may be set<br>aside for secondary education in2006-07. How can Budget 2006<br>effectively spend about Rs.2000 crore more onsecondary education?<br><br>Today, the capacity and policy framework at thesecondary level is<br>inadequate. The SSA focuses on Class I through VIII.There are 206,269<br>middle schools in the country. But the number ofhigh/secondary<br>schools, which go from Class IX to XII, is only126,047.<br><br>The gap in rural areas is higher than the average. In urbanareas, the<br>weakness of the public system is overcome by private schools.Can<br>rural children relocate to a neighbouring town to attend school?<br>Thoughthe actual fee for private schools is often quite low, living<br>in the towninvolves additional living expenses. The total outlay is<br>out of reach forthe poorest rural students. There are publicly funded<br>scholarship schemesavailable for SC and ST students in a number of<br>states. Tamil Nadu givesbicycles to girls in villages enrolled in<br>secondary schools to enable themto attend schools that are further<br>away. But, in general, states do nothave enough funds to put money<br>into secondary schooling.<br><br>Further,a major lacuna has emerged in education in India as a<br>consequence ofresources being directed towards a social agenda. This<br>is that there arevery few initiatives to promote merit. A few rare<br>initiatives like&quot;gaon ki beti&quot; by the Madhya Pradesh State Government<br>rewardexcellence - but this barely gives one scholarhip to one bright<br>girlstudent in a village. Today India has some of the best higher<br>educationinstitutions in the world like the IITs, but the quality of<br>education forthe average child in India is extremely low.<br><br>In this context, how canthe new money for secondary education be best<br>spent? The traditionalapproach is that the government open a large<br>number of secondary schools.The difficulties and costs of this<br>strategy can be gauged by the experiencethe government has had with<br>running primary schools. Getting good secondaryschool teachers to<br>work in rural schools will be a big task. Gettingteachers to be<br>present in school will be another job and getting them toteach, when<br>they face no threat of dismissal or pay cut, equally onerous.The<br>traditional approach has failed to provide quality education in<br>elementaryschools.<br><br>The other option is to facilitate the best students to studyin nearby<br>secondary schools by offering them scholarships which cansupport<br>expenditures on fees, books, living expenses, etc. A scholarship of<br>justRs.300 per month suffices. Scholarships can be allocated to<br>states based onthe population. So UP will have more scholarships than<br>Goa. Studentsenrolled in Class IX in any school, public or private,<br>should be chosen bythe state government on the basis of merit,<br>through a standardisedscholarship examination administered at Class<br>VIII. The money should begiven directly to the student or the mother<br>through a money order or atransfer to a bank account. It should be<br>given to them for a period of 4years - Class IX to Class XII,<br>requiring that the child is promoted to thenext class.<br><br>The arithmetic works out so that Rs.2000 crore pays for5.5 million<br>scholarships. This number is big enough to generate a supplyresponse<br>from schools in the private sector. More sections will be addedto<br>higher classes. More private middle schools will add higher classesto<br>secondary schools. More secondary schools will be opened. Thequality<br>of the schools will improve as better students will be able toafford<br>education. If the allocation is raised to 50 percent of the cess<br>starting2007-08 for the duration of the 11 Plan, then by the end of<br>the EleventhPlan period there should be considerably widened capacity<br>for secondaryschooling in India.<br><br>At present, the central and state governmentstogether spend<br>approximately Rs 3000 per student through the publiceducation<br>system. The scholarship is nearly the same amount, but insteadof<br>getting lost in the bottomless pit of the government system where<br>thereis no evaluation or accountability, it puts the money directly<br>into thehands of the parent who can choose which school the child<br>will attend.<br><br>Butwon't the already privileged students, who any way do better at<br>school, getall the scholarships? First, let us remember, the poor<br>students are muchmore motivated to get the scholarships, and would<br>thus try harder for theexamination. The scholarship gives them a<br>chance to go to upper grades,something which they cannot otherwise<br>do. Second, even among the childrenwho are not poor, a merit based<br>scholarship comes with prestige and willincentivise them to work<br>harder. <br><br>When every village child (andparent) knows that such a scholarship is<br>available for more educationprovided there is merit, the performance<br>in elementary school will alsoimprove. Allocating money to secondary<br>schooling in this manner can,therefore, not only provide secondary<br>education, it can push elementaryeducation beyond merely enrolment<br>and towards better outcomes. Encouragingbright and hard working<br>students to go for higher education will havemutlitple benefits. As a<br>country and a growing economy with a fastexpanding service sector,<br>India needs a large well educated labour force.The money will be well<br>spent even from a purely commercial point of view asit will increase<br>human capital and give higher GDP growth.<br><br><br><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div></body></html>
