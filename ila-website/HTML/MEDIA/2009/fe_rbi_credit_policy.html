  Dated data, poor policy

<p>Will the RBI announce a cut in interest rates in its credit policy
announcement or will this policy also be a non-event as have been the
previous two policy announcements? A large number of market
participants expect that no significant monetary easing will be
announced. However, their expectations are based on looking at year on
year price data which says more about the past and less about recent
behaviour of prices. </p>

<p>For a long time the RBI appeared to have focused on the Wholesale
Price Index. Now the WPI has come down sharply, and is close to zero,
and a case could have been made to ease monetary policy. But more
recently the focus appears to have shifted to the Consumer Price Index
(CPI). Many analysts seem to be arguing that the RBI may not ease
policy since the CPI is still high. </p>

<p>The CPI for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) has been in double digit
levels despite the decline in the WPI after September 2008. The
question then is what is this attributible to and what does the RBI
expect for the CPI in coming months. The latest CPI-IW data is
available for February and shows inflation of 9.63 percent over
February last year. Part of the reason for the increase in CPI is the
larger share of food than is present in WPI. In CPI-IW the share of
food is 46.20, in WPI the share of food is 15.4 percent. Food prices
were rising at levels higher than most other components of WPI
contributing to the rise in CPI-IW. In February, for example, the year
on year rise in food prices was 9.8 percent and that in CPI-IW was 9.3
percent. All other prices grew more slowly. The only really unknown
variable is housing prices, which has a weight of 15.27 in CPI-IW and
for which no data series is available. </p>

<p>What might be expected for March CPI-IW? In March food prices have
come down to a yoy growth rate of 6.9 percent. Considering that all
other prices have come down even more sharply (WPI Manufacturing to
1.87, WPI fuel to -6.2, and WPI Primary to 4.07), it is likely that
CPI will also hover at around 7 percent or below. </p>

<p>Output, measured by IIP, has in the meanwhile been falling
sharply. The yoy growth figures are showing a decline sharper and more
persistent than one has seen for more than 15 years. December showed
IIP growth at -0.63, January showed 0.4 yoy growth and the February
numbers were down at -1.23 percent. </p>

<p>The difficulty with looking at yoy data, rather than seasonally
adjusted month on month data, as do all other central banks, is that
instead of looking at recent trends, policy decisions are made by
looking at the impact of shocks that have happened over the past 12
months. To use the latest trends to forecast the future, it is
important to seasonally adjust the data and then look at month on
month changes. Work at the National Institute of Public Finance and
Policy (http://www.nipfp.org.in/working_paper/wp_2008_54.pdf) shows
how this has made a very big difference to the formulation of monetary
policy in the past. Similar analysis is now showing a sharp decline in
WPI inflation, far steeper than what is observed in the yoy data. For
the period since September seasonally adjusted WPI month on month
annualised inflation has been negative in 6 out of 7 months. In other
words, after taking care of seasonal factors, month after month prices
have actually been falling in most months. </p>

<p>Similarly when we look at seasonally adjusted month on month CPI
based inflation the picture is more sanguine. While the CPI is not in
negative territory, since October 2008 it has been in single digits in
4 out of the 5 months for which data is available. In February the
annualised month on month seasonally adjusted number fell to 6.3
percent. </p>

<p>Central banks using seasonally adjusted data as described above,
often prepare forecasts for inflation and output in coming
months. These are not necessarily forecasts meant to be accurate to
the point, but rather to describe scenarios which might play out in
coming months. These scenarios are then used to convey to markets what
might be the inflation and output projections that the central bank is
looking at to make informed decisions about the future. Such analysis
also helps markets to understand the logic of the central bank's
policy decisions. </p>

<p>Indian markets would benefit greatly if the RBI could do similar
analysis. One reason for not doing it is that inflation numbers are
bad. The second reason could be that producing seaonally adjusted
numbers is the responsibility of the Central Statistical Office, not
the RBI. While all these are valid reasons, as our work above has
shown, even a small effort by the RBI can go a long way. </p>
