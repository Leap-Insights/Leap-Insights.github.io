<h1>India in the Great Recession<h1>

<h3>I. Conditions are reminiscent of the 1992 and 1999 downturns</h3>

<p><img style="float: right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="450"
src="iigr_fig1.jpg" />While we are all aware that India is in a downturn,
the exceptional circumstances that we are now placed in are not widely
appreciated. Figure 1 shows the long time-series of year-on-year
growth (smoothed) of industrial production. The recent period shows a
marked slowdown. Negative values have come about. Industrial
production growth seems to be at the worst levels since 1993. What we
are facing is exceptional; the last time this happened was 16 years
ago.</p>

<p>Other signs of stress are also building up. Capital inflows have
dropped from a peak of over $30 billion a quarter to slightly negative
values in the Oct-Nov-Dec 2008 quarter. This constitutes a `sudden
stop' of capital flows. The fiscal situation has also worsened
considerably, with a slowdown in tax collections. The collapse in
industrial growth, coupled with the difficulties of public finance,
add up to a gloomy environment. The only comparable experiences are
found in the business cycle downturns of the early 1990s and the end
of the 1990s.</p>

<h3>II. The heart of the problem is investment</h3>

<p>India is now
in <a href="http://openlib.org/home/ila/MEDIA/2009/fe_drivers.html">new
territory on investment</a>. The share of investment in GDP, which
used to hover around 25%, has gone all the way up to 40% of GDP. Under
normal circumstances, this bodes well, for high investment presages
high GDP growth. But there is a problem. Investment, and particularly
private corporate investment, is highly unstable in all market
economies. Fluctuations of investment are a key source of business
cycle fluctuations.</p>

<p><img style="float: right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="450"
src="iigr_fig2.jpg" />Figure 2 shows the dramatic changes that have taken
place in India's investment. The three components of investment --
government, household and private corporate -- are expressed as
percent of GDP. We see that for the first time in India's history, in
recent years, private corporate investment has exceeded that by the
government. Government investment is based on the budgetary process,
and does not change much from year to year. Household investment is
also relatively stable. Private corporate investment moves around
substantially, based on the optimism of the private sector about
India's future. </p>

<p>Private corporate investment was at around 5% when Narasimha Rao
and Manmohan Singh unleashed the reforms of the early 1990s. This gave
a rise in investment to 10%. Then the business cycle downturn came
about, and it fell back to 5%. After this, the reforms of the Vajpayee
government from 1999 to 2002 were able to reignite confidence, and
private corporate investment went back up to 16% of GDP. The numerical
values seen
in <a href="http://www.business-beacon.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=winv">the
investment pipeline today</a> are simply enormous. The extent to which
it is translated into actual investment spending is of essence to
the <a href="http://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/PDFDOCS/Shah2008_whatchanged.pdf">new
logic of Indian business cycle fluctuations</a>.</p>

<p>If the recent upsurge of private corporate investment reverses
itself, we could see a drop from 16% of GDP to 6% of GDP.  Each
percentage point of GDP, today, is Rs.50,000 crore, so we are
discussing massive numbers. A ten percentage point decline of private
corporate investment is a decline in investment demand of Rs.500,000
crore.</p>

<h3>III. We are only analysing possibilities for 2009-11</h3>

<p>It must be emphasised that we are discussing a possible scenario
for 2009-10 and 2010-11, and not a fact. Figure 2 above shows that
private corporate investment has moved around dramatically in response
to the changing optimism of the private sector. Optimism has clearly
dropped dramatically in recent months. But we do not yet know the
extent to which private corporate investment will drop in 2009-10 and
2010-11.</p>

<p><img style="float: right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="450"
src="iigr_fig3.jpg" />Figure 3 shows recent data for production and imports
of capital goods. This data only runs till December 2008. It shows a
sharp slowdown in the year-on-year growth of both imports and
production of capital goods.</p>

<p>While these early indicators are worrisome, the jury is still out
on whether investment in 2009-10 and 2010-11 will slowdown
substantially when compared with the previous two years. However, even
if this is only a scenario, this is the defining question for India's
economic outlook, and the policy debate, when thinking about
2009-10. The critical questions are now: <i>What can policy makers do
to reduce the decline in private corporate investment? And, if a
substantial drop arises, how can the damage be contained?</i></p>

<h3>IV. Fiscal and monetary policy are mere spectators</h3>

<p>Economists generally think in terms of counteracting business cycle
fluctuations using fiscal policy and monetary policy. But in India,
both fiscal policy and monetary policy institutions are quite
feeble. They do not have the capability to make a substantial
difference if the challenge that is posed to them is counteracting a
decline in private corporate investment of Rs.500,000 crore a year.</p>

<p>In coming years, India must build up high quality fiscal, financial
and monetary policy institutions. These institutions will give the
institutional capability through which stabilisation can be done. This
is a desirable goal, and should be undertaken. Indeed, the job of
fiscal, financial and monetary policy reform should be the task number
one on the agenda of the next government. But as far as the present
downturn is concerned, the damage has been done. The time to fix the
roof was when the sun was shining. But India did not make progress in
the good years. Now, in the short term, we are faced with a storm, and
the institutional capabilities required for stabilisation are
absent. If the challenge is a potential decline of investment by
Rs.500,000 crore a year, fiscal policy and monetary policy are mere
spectators.</p>

<h3>V. How can policy makers make a difference?</h3>

<p>What shapes private corporate investment? In recent years, there
was optimism that India was going to consistently grow at over 8% a
year. Once this high growth environment was seemingly in place, the
firms were not worried about India's shaky economic policy
foundations. The perception of low risk and high expected returns gave
an environment where the private sector plunged in to invest.</p>

<p>That scenario has now been disrupted. If the outlook for India is
more gloomy, with a growth outlook of 4-6%, then much lower investment
will take place. In boom times, all sins were forgiven, but in the
present environment, the private sector is asking difficult questions
about all aspects of State functioning. Now the private sector is
worried about India's shaky institutional foundations on economic
policy. The private sector needs to be persuaded that India is serious
about economic policy reform, so as to get back to an optimistic
environment where India is on the move, growth expectations are
strong, and investment gets going again.</p>

<p>The will to invest of the private sector is thus shaped by `animal
spirits' of private corporations. Today, the private sector has a low
opinion of the interest or willingness of the Indian government to
reform itself. The outlook today is one of a moribund India, trapped
in ideology, lacking in execution capability, unable to make
significant changes in any aspect of government, which will trundle
along at 4-6% growth. Is India able to take on holy cows? Does
economic policy making have common sense? Are we able to
clear-headedly analyse problems, and translate sound analysis into
action? Are we able to tread on toes? These are the critical
questions.</p>

<h3>VI. How to break the gloom?</h3>

<p>In order to break with this gloom, the new government must unveil a
reforms program in three areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li> Fiscal, financial and monetary institution building
  <li> Proper financing of the State
  <li> Expenditure reforms on both public goods and on subsidies.
</ol>

<p>In each of these three areas, a substantial laundry list can be
made of what needs to be done. The next budget speech does not need to
solve all the problems. It only needs to match Narasimha Rao over 1991
and 1992, and A. B. Vajpayee over 1999-2002, in terms of putting down
enough of a down payment in economic reform so as to ignite
optimism.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Fiscal, financial and monetary institution building</dt><dd>Under
institution building are the long-standing problems of reforming law
and institutions. This includes problems of RBI's transparency, the
merger of all securities markets functions into SEBI (including the
commodity futures work that is presently at FMC and the interest rates
and currency work that is presently at RBI), the establishment of the
Bond-Currency-Derivatives Nexus, and removing entry barriers in
banking. With the Patil, Mistry, Rajan and Aziz reports which were
done from 2005 to 2008, the technical work of planning out the reforms
is in place. What is needed now is execution.</dd>

<dt>Proper financing of the State</dt><dd>What is now needed is new fiscal
responsibility legislation, the establishment of a Debt Management
Office, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, the removal
of `bad taxes' including all cesses, all taxes on turnover such as
stamp duty and the securities transaction tax, and barriers to
globalisation such as customs duty. Given the immense escalation of
public debt, government needs to obtain fiscal space through debt
reduction by asset sales. Even if there is only a symbolic gesture of
selling off 10 loss-making PSUs, it will have considerable signalling
value, for it will show an India that is not trapped in ideology, that
is able to pragmatically analyse problems and solve them.</dd>

<dt>Expenditure reforms on both public goods and on
subsidies.</dt><dd>In terms of expenditure, the first challenge is
that of refocusing the government to effectively deliver public
goods. This involves setting up a proper police force and judiciary, a
fundamental transformation of urban governance, a break with the holy
cows on higher education, and genuine execution capabilities for
critical infrastructure projects such as NHAI, the Bombay-Delhi
industrial corridor, 3G telephony, broadband, and urban metro
systems. In the areas of education and health, fundamental change is
required to reorient government from spending money to obtaining
outcomes.</br>
The NREG is an important step forward in delivering cash to poor
people. Once cash has been sent to every BPL family in India, the
hundreds of distortions and subsidy programs that have been setup in
the name of helping poor people can be disbanded. As an example, the
LPG subsidy has nothing to do with helping poor people, and only
serves to hold back GDP growth. Replacing the food, fertiliser and
petroleum product subsidies by a cash transfer to BPL households will
make a big difference in derisking the exchequer.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Movement on these three fronts -- institution building, financing
of the State, and sensible expenditure -- will ignite animal
spirits. The private sector will once again see that India has a
chance of obtaining and sustaining above 8% growth. Once this is in
hand, a series of bottlenecks which reduce the ability to invest will
matter. These include restrictions on FDI, capital controls which
prevent capital from coming into India, problems of the land market,
and labour law. The new government needs to attack these bottlenecks
also.</p>

<h3>VII. What if a large decline in investment does come about?</h3>

<p>While the new government must do all it can to reignite the `animal
spirits' of private investors, we must not assume that this will work
out successfully. We must simultaneously ask ourselves the question:
If despite our best efforts, a large drop in investment does come
about, how can we absorb the shock better? What can be done to
minimise the damage, and bounce back effectively when the storm
passes? There are four areas for work: </p>

<ol> <li> <img style="float: right" hspace="10" vspace="10"
width="450" src="iigr_fig4.jpg" />The first is about positive feedback
loops. Faulty policy structures have positive feedback loops. In
India, when times are good, interest rates tend to go down in real
terms. When times are bad, interest rates tend to go up in real
terms. Figure 4 shows the policy rate of RBI, expressed in real terms
[<a
 href="http://ajayshahblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/working-paper-early-warnings-of.html">methodology</a>]
The graph shows big values of the real rate in the dark days of 1999
and in recent months. It shows small values in the boom times of 2004
and 2008. Through this, monetary policy makes good times better and
bad times worse. Such sources of pro-cyclicality need to be identified
and blocked.

<li> Institution building in fiscal, financial and monetary policy
will enable stabilisation. But this can only yield results in the
medium term. In the short term, the only tool for stabilisation that
is easily accessed is a floating exchange rate. In good times, the
rupee should appreciate and in bad times the rupee should
depreciate. This will be a potent force in favour of
stabilisation. Many people in India believe that RBI helps matters by
reducing the volatility of the rupee-dollar exchange rate. However,
such efforts exacerbate the boom and bust cycle of the market economy.

<li> The third key area for work lies in finance. When bad times
arrive, many companies find themselves making losses. Some of these
companies are weak and must die. But the survival of better companies
through the storm critically relies on a financial system that is able
to deliver additional debt and equity capital, in a discriminating
way, into the better firms. This requires progress on financial sector
reforms. The implementation of the Patil, Mistry and Rajan reports
will materially help.

<li> The fourth dimension of coping with bad times is flexibility of
resource allocation. Absorbing the downturn is critically about people
being fired, people being hired, firms closing down, firms starting
up, workers migrating from one place to another, and factories or
companies being sold. Government must work to improve flexibility of
resource allocation, so that a new configuration of firms, workers and
capital is found, that is able to flourish. The more impediments there
are to flexibility, the longer and more protracted the downturn will
be.
</ol>

<h3>VIII. Conclusion</h3>

<p><img style="float: right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="450"
src="iigr_fig5.jpg" />In summary, the defining question today is about
the extent to which private firms have the will to invest and the
ability to invest. A significant decline in the investment to GDP
ratio will trigger off a painful downturn. In order to stave off this
scenario, the new government must undertake a broad program of
economic reforms, comparable with what Narasimha Rao did in 1991-1992
and what A. B. Vajpayee did over 1999-2002, so as to ignite animal
spirits, inspire confidence in India's future, and improve private
corporate investment. At the same time, work is needed on four tracks
in order to cope with a decline in investment (if it should arise):
blocking feedback loops, exchange rate flexibility, improved flows of
financing from outside the firm, and flexibility of resource
allocation.</p>
