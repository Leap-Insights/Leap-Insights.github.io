<p>One of the most interesting questions facing the world today is
what may be called ``the USD problem''. What will happen to the USD
and to US interest rates? If large market movements take place, who
will be the gainers and losers?</p>

<p>The US today imports capital worth 5.1% of GDP to pay for its
fiscal deficit of that exact magnitude. Among the largest suppliers of
capital are the governments of China and Japan. As of April,
Japanese reserves were at $827 billion and China (+Hong Kong) was at
$565 billion.</p>

<p>What is not widely understood is that <i>these countries now have a
big stake in the USD</i>. In the bad scenario, the USD will lose
value, and US interest rates will go up (i.e. US bond prices would go
down). This would inflict pain on the USD securities held by China and
Japan.</p>

<p>Normal financial reasoning suggests that the reserves portfolio
should be diversified across many currencies, and particularly avoid
currencies such as the USD where a large depreciation may be in
store.</p>

<p>However, China and Japan have such large holdings of US securities,
that they can no longer think like a normal portfolio investor. In a
recent paper, Dooley, Landau and Garber argue that these countries are
no longer price takers, it is now a strategic game. The size of their
holdings has robbed them of room for maneouver. If China and/or Japan
sell USD in a normal quest for portfolio diversification, it would set
off dramatic events in financial markets all over the world. It would
generate large losses and fiscal costs for the two countries, and
disrupt their prevailing currency regime.</p>

<p>China and Japan may have once embarked on reserves accumulation in
order to "obtain insurance", but they are now riding a tiger. Their
situation is that of a large market manipulator, who finds it easy to
keep buying on the way up, but finds himself stuck with warehouses
overflowing and no easy exit at the top. The situation of China and
Japan on USD securities is not unlike that of LTCM in August 1998,
where positions have become so large that the flexibility of portfolio
management has been lost.</p>

<p>Thus both countries stand to lose by following existing policies,
but there is little they can do about it. China and Japan are in `the
USD quagmire': It is not easy for them to extricate themselves from
this situation.</p>

<p>What impact does this have on the world economy? Given the size of
Chinese holdings of US government bonds, and given the role of the
Chinese reserves accretion in funding the twin deficits of the US,
difficulties in China will spill over into the USD currency and bond
markets. Kenneth Rogoff has recently written that if there is a
financial crisis in China, the IMF does not command the scale of
resources that are required to mount a rescue.</p>

<p>This is a rich and interesting situation, and all kinds of
interesting scenarios can be considered. For example, one juicy
scenario involves blackmail. China could go up to George W. Bush with
a list of demands, backed by a threat to sell $300 billion of US
government bonds. This threatened sale of bonds would generate massive
financial market turbulence and a rise in US interest rates, which
would make it much harder for Mr. Bush to get re-elected in
November.</p>

<p>Another fascinating twist on this story is the interplay between
China/Japan and US monetary policy. Suppose the US Fed chooses to seek
higher interest rates, reflecting the end of recessionary conditions
in the US. In this quest, the massive pace of US bond buying by China
and Japan, which induces low interest rates, comes in the way.</p>

<p>The impact of a change in private expectations about the USD and US
bonds could also be dramatic. The sale of USD by foreign private
holders could lead to dollar depreciation. Would Japan and China step
in to rescue the USD? If they don't, their wealth declines and their
currency regime gets disrupted; if they do, they add to the size of
their problem.</p>

<p>It is obviously very difficult to anticipate where this is going,
and to accurately describe how the story will unfold. But the
underlying tensions are very real. Things that can't go on, don't. The
Chinese bubble economy, the US fiscal deficit, the US current account
deficit, the Japanese currency manipulation and the reserves
accumulation of China and Japan: all these unhappy plot elements are
deeply inter-related. A dramatic denouement may take place, which
resolves all these problems. This will involve plenty of excitement in
finance and macroeconomics. It is important to start envisioning the
outlines of that endgame, and to speculate about the identities of the
gainers and losers.</p>

<p>What does all this mean for India? Our main goal should be to
distance ourselves from the Japan-China-US triad and the USD, so as to
minimise the extent to which dramatic events on the USD quagmire can
affect us in the future.</p>

<p>Luckily, India's name has not figured in any of the above
paragraphs. Our <b>first</b> goal should be to keep it this way,
i.e. to avoid the Chinese/Japanese problems of absurd levels of
reserves. We are already well past sensible levels of reserves, and
our goal should be not to pile on any more. We should never allow our
reserves position to become so large that we lose room for
maneouver.</p>

<p><b>Second</b>, RBI did very well in moving away from the USD as the
right time, and roughly 50% of reserves are now USD. India should
continue to go down this path to much lower USD holdings. Would you
hold gold or USD in your portfolio if you knew that their prices were
going to fall? While China and Japan have holdings which are so large
that such rebalancing is not possible, India faces no such
constraint. Barry Eichengreen has argued that smaller economies still
have the scope to diversify without any serious problems. We can dump
the hot potato and the trapped Japanese/Chinese will probably buy up
our holdings.</p>

<p>The <b>third</b> element of an Indian response is to shift NRI
deposits to being Euro denominated. The Euro and the GBP are currently
a safe harbour: currencies which are not direct participants in the
USD quagmire, and backed by sound economic institutions who do not
engage in market manipulation. We should constantly find ways of
delinking ourselves from the USD and using EUR/GBP instead.</p>

<p>The <b>fourth</b> element of an Indian response is either move to a
floating exchange rate, or atleast to shift away from pegging to the
USD to pegging to a basket. In recent months there is evidence of a
retreat from the traditional tight narrow band of 10-15 paisa per
day. A further increase in the width of the band, and a shift away
from the USD as the target currency, will set the stage for shedding
our excess baggage of reserves.</p>
