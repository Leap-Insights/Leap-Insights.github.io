    Kelkar’s one-stop solution for fiscal woes

<p><i><b><font color="#CC0000">GOODS & SERVICES TAX:</font></b> It can help reduce corruption & evasion, says Kelkar</i></p>

<p>Of all the reports that he has ever submitted, this one is like a favourite child. Vijay Kelkar’s eyes light up at the mention of GST, the simple and comprehensive tax that he has proposed on Goods and Services.</p>

<p>Even for a man who has spent decades dealing with bureaucratic hurdles, the politics of tax evasion and the cynicism of a disillusioned country, this is a magic bullet. Kelkar is convinced that GST will not only solve India’s fiscal problem, but it can also set the country on the path of high growth. </p>

<p>‘‘Even if I say so myself, this is so beautiful because of its simplicity,’’ he told The Indian Express at the end of a hectic stint as Advisor to the Finance Minister. </p>

<p>The GST is an all-encompassing 20 per cent tax that he has proposed on goods and services that we consume, to be shared between the Centre and the states. In one go, it will replace the octroi, the stamp duties and other assorted taxes that actually add up to nearly 30 per cent, are difficult to collect and encourage evasion and corruption. ‘‘We should be focused on the kilometre-long queues of trucks—how to get rid of those,’’ he says. </p>

<p>And he wasn’t just looking at an accounting exercise to get the deficit down. ‘‘Otherwise, we could have just raised taxes and cut expenditure,’’ says Kelkar. Instead, he was charting out a path to faster growth. </p>

<p>‘‘We must do it now,’’ he says. ‘‘The next two decades are a once in a lifetime opportunity for high growth.’’ </p>

<p>Why? Because the demographics are such that India will have its highest-ever share of the working population. After that, the society will start to grey. </p>

<p>‘‘A poor, ageing society cannot eliminate poverty,’’ says Kelkar. </p>

<p>But a good tax system can go a long way. By reforming in the 1990s, China not only managed to raise its tax/GDP ratio by a massive four percentage points but also gave its manufacturing sector a boost by moving to VAT. </p>

<p>In India, with services virtually not being taxed, all the burden falls on sectors like manufacturing. The high taxes are killing its growth and stopping it from tapping foreign markets. </p>

<p>‘‘Remember, we have to accept the logic of integrating with the global economy,’’ says Kelkar. ‘‘We cannot charge taxes on foreigners who are our customers, and if the Narayanamurthys find it is cheaper to work out of China, they can just move out.’’ </p>

<p>But time is running out as even Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have switched to GST. Meanwhile, India is still debating if such a move will take autonomy away from the states. </p>

<p>Kelkar says that the states have already agreed to a floor rate of 4 per cent and are currently discussing a uniform VAT on goods. ‘‘In fact, the states don’t even seem to say that it is a loss of autonomy, it’s only the ideologues who do.’’ </p>

<p>He adds: ‘‘I’d argue that real autonomy lies in being able to spend as you like, in having more to spend.’’ </p>

<p>Others have suggested that the idea might not work because of bad compliance. Kelkar’s response is TIN, the Tax Information Network, which, in just nine months, has changed the way bureaucrats and economists look at tax collection. </p>

<p>‘‘It is a conceptual breakthrough,’’ says Kelkar. ‘‘The government can outsource a non-core activity like tax information.’’ And if 2.9 lakh employers can be digitally accounted for when income-tax is concerned, scrutinising them for GST is surely feasible. </p>

<p>Tax collection has increased by more than 50 per cent, compared to one year ago, because it has now become possible to digitally track down discrepancies, says C B Bhave, the chief of the National Securities Depository Limited, which has been assigned the job of implementing TIN. </p>

<p>‘‘GST is what India needs now,’’ says Kelkar.</p>
