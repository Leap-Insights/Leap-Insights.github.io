<p>The support given to the Congress government by the left parties is
creating two kinds of fears in the minds of many people. The first is
the fear that the economic policies of the government would move away
from the market friendly policies being followed by the NDA. These
fears have been heightened by numerous statements on disinvestment,
labour laws, and reservation. Whether this fear is justified or not,
and whether Dr Manmohan Singh's term will see India going back to a
larger role for the public sector and an inspector raj will have to be
seen. The choice of the PM and FM is a signal by the Congress that it
will try not to let this happen. </p>

<p>The second fear created by the populist slogans in the CMP is that
there will be a sharp increase in public spending on various social
programmes. It is feared that the government will spend more on free power,
free water, employment guarantee schemes, education, health, subsidies on
petroleum products, interest payments, and so on. The obvious question is
how will these be financed. </p>

<p>The saving grace seems to be that no one in the political system
has demanded that higher expenditure be financed out of higher
deficits. The CMP supports the FRBM that seeks to bring down the level
of the revenue deficit to zero within the next 4-5 years. While
disinvestment as a source of revenue is clearly in trouble, left
leaders have suggested that rich farmers should be taxed, and
professionals currently escaping the tax net should be brought into
the tax system.  </p>

<p>Lowering deficits is not a popular policy. It means raising taxes
and cutting expenditure. It is much easier to be myopic and spend
today, leaving it to future governments to face the music. Lower
deficits also generate lower growth in the short run by reducing
aggregate demand and reducing the feel-good factor. The fact that no
political party is explicitly asking for higher deficits makes it
easier for Mr. Chidambaram to go ahead with fiscal consolidation. This
is very fortunate because high fiscal deficits have many undesired
side-effects. </p>

<p>The 1980s witnessed high growth rates with high fiscal
deficits. They ultimately spilled over onto the external sector and
led to a current account crisis. The nineties did not see that happen
because of a sharp rise in household savings. Distortionary tax
exemptions and routing of household savings into government bonds
through the banking system meant that the government borrowed the bulk
of additional savings. The capture of additional private savings by
the government also did not raise interest rates in the post-1996
years. Real interest rates did not rise because private demand was
low. Currently, the economy appears to be on the upswing of a growth
cycle. With an increase in private demand, the pre-emption of
household savings by the government could put an upward pressure on
rates. </p>

<p>Further, the increase in public debt has had a disasterous effects
on the provision of public goods in India. Since half of government
spending goes into servicing this debt, less money is available at all
levels of government - central, state or local, for provision of
public goods. Law and order, enforcement of contracts, health and
education are important determinants of growth. While India has seen
significant economic growth, improvements in public services and
infrastructure has not kept pace. They are today severely constrained
by the availability of resources. If interest payments use up the bulk
of revenue collection, little is left for provision of public
services.</p>

<p>Usually politicians are willing to ignore the long term interests
of government finances and of the public in their attempts to provide
hand outs to this or that section of the electorate. They rarely
commit to cutting deficits. If the current governmment adopts a
programme to do so, it is to be applauded.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, very disconcerting to find economists arguing in
favour of running high deficits. Earlier this month Sudhir Mulji, in
his column in this newspaper, argued that the government needs
Keynesian policies. Notwithstanding the inefficiency of the government
in undertaking public expenditure, the argument that the government
can go ahead and borrow as much as it likes, rests on the belief that
India has had fiscal deficits (combined deficit of the centre and
states) of nearly 10 percent for over 20 years without facing a
crisis, so all is well and the government can keep on borrowing. It
ignores the fact that over these twenty years India has built up a
debt GDP ratio of 85 percent. As this ratio has increased, the cost of
servicing the debt has risen. </p>

<p>It is argued that if the government borrows more to invest then it
will increase the productivity of private capital by creating
infrastructure. One wishes this were true. Unfortunately, the Indian
bureaucracy, which is expected to undertake this public investment, does
not have a very good track record. Theft and corruption have plagued
public spending in India. Returns are low, both in terms of GDP growth
and user charges. The quality of national highways improved
only after the autonomous body created for this purpose, the NHAI
undertook the job. The state of the rest of the roads, government
schools and hospitals are a sad commentary on the efficiency of public
investment. </p>

<p>Higher deficits would increase demand. In a year where
there has been GDP growth of 8.5 percent, capacity utilisation is
high. Without capacity building on the supply side the danger of
demand spillovers onto the external sector, or prices would be
higher. </p>

<p>Fortunately, India has very few Keynesians like Sudhir Mulji. And,
hopefully Mr. Chidambaram does not listen to the few that are
there. If higher expenditure has to be incurred to pacify his
supporters, he should raise the revenues to do so. The
coming budget is a chance for Mr Chidambaram to show that at least
some fears about his government are unfounded. He will have a far more
difficult time on the front of market friendly reforms. He should,
therefore, make the most of the chance to cut deficits and raise revenue. </p>

<p> Also, fortunately until now none of his comrades are suggesting
that income tax rates be raised. No one is suggesting taxing of luxury
goods. Mr Chidambaram should make the most of this by improving the
efficiency of the tax system, expanding the tax base to services and
lowering tax rates, a strategy likely to rake in higher tax
collections. With emphasis on effective tax reform and fiscal
consolidation, this budget could be another path breaker by the dream
budget minister. </p>
