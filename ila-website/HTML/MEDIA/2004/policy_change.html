<p>Nearly two weeks of little intervention by the RBI has given a
sharp appreciation as the rupee catches up with market
fundamentals. This has led to speculation about whether RBI's currency
policy has changed. A number of explanations have been offered about
why RBI's policy might have changed. However, questions about why
there is a change in policy should be asked only after we know that
there has indeed been a change in policy.</p>

<p>How do we know what is RBI's currency policy and whether it has
changed? Surely, if people believed what the RBI says i.e. that the
rupee is market determined, they would have believed that there was no
change in policy. However, discussions last week indicate that RBI's
official stance is not believed.</p>

<p>This is not surprising. Central banks all over the world are known
to lie, especially about currency policy, so why should anything
different be expected from the RBI? The systematic pattern of central
banks that lie about currency policy was noticed in the international
literature a couple of years ago. Until then research on the impact of
currency regimes (fixed, floating etc.) on growth was based on the
official classification of the exchange rate regime. Researchers got
very unsatisfying results. They then turned to the question: were
central banks telling the truth when they claimed that the exchange rate
regime was fixed or floating? It was observed that in more than half
the countries where the exchange rate was claimed to be market
determined, there was heavy market manipulation to ensure that the
exchange rate did not truly float.</p>

<p>In reality such central banks often "peg" the exchange rate. The
term pegging needs to be explained. Pegging is <i>not</i> the same as
a fixed exchange rate. It is a regime under which the central bank
trades heavily to influence the exchange rate versus one particular
international currency. So, for instance, if a central bank focusses
on the US dollar, it trades to prevent significant movement of the
domestic currency against the US dollar. Countries in the British
Empire tended to peg their currencies to the Pound Sterling. French
colonies tended to peg their currencies to the French Franc. For many
years the German Mark became the currency to which countries in Europe
would peg their currencies.</p>

<p>How can an external observer cut through the maze of claims about a
"market determined exchange rate", and tell whether pegging to a given
currency is afoot?</p>

<p>One way of defining a peg asks if the probability that monthly
exchange rate changes remain within a one percent band with a
probability of over 80% over a five-year period. The exchange rate may
go through periods of both appreciation and depreciation. As this
definition shows, this currency has extremely little flexibility.</p>

<p>In such a situation, the volatility of the domestic currency
against the USD becomes low. However, the volatility of the domestic
currency against other currencies becomes as high as that of the USD
against them. Moreover, changes in the exchange rate versus a
numeraire (a currency which does not figure in the country's trade or
capital accounts) are explained by changes in the exchange rate of the
USD against the numeraire.</p>

<p>Coming back to the recent discussion in India, what market
participants need is to cut through official claims of RBI, and
decipher the <i>de facto</i> currency regime. </p>

<p>What is the evidence on the currency regime in India? Recent
research has provided evidence that the rupee has been pegged to the
US dollar since 1979. The flexibility of the rupee versus the US
dollar has not increased even after the rupee was supposed to have
become "market determined" in 1993.</p>

<p>While the daily volatility of the Indian rupee versus the US
dollar, has been around 0.1 per cent per day in the last two years,
that against the Euro and the Japanese Yen (JPY) has been around
0.7. This matches the USD/Euro and the USD/JPY volatilities of around
0.7. RBI claims to want to "contain market volatility", but the
INR/EUR and INR/JPY volatilities are exactly as large as those found
with a market determined rate. This telltale pattern in volatilities
constitutes very persuasive evidence of pegging.</p>

<p>Further, the changes in the exchange rate of the rupee versus the
Swiss Franc (CHF), an unrelated currency, can be almost fully
explained by changes in the exchange rate of the USD/CHF and not by
other currencies such as the Euro or the JPY. These tests are based on
"Frankel-Wei regressions", and they are a powerful way to catch the
conscience of the currency regime.</p>

<p>This battery of evidence suggests that currency policy in India has
consisted of a low-volatility peg to the USD. While this is
quantitative and scientific and satisfying, this evidence is not
surprising to anyone who has been watching the behaviour of the
rupee.</p>


<p>In the last two weeks there have certainly been a few large moves
in the INR/USD rate. But is this a change in regime? Was the current
rate merely a target to which the RBI allowed the exchange rate to
move sharply to? Is the RBI now going to go back to tightly
controlling the movement of the currency? Or, will the rupee be
allowed to have greater volatility in the future?</p>


<p>In other words, has the currency regime changed? Given that central
banks are nontransparent, we need to look at the data. Two weeks is
too little time to tell. Perhaps 100 days will be enough to get a
sense of what is going on.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the market will continue to play guessing games
with the RBI.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the RBI is not alone in its official stance on
the currency regime. Some literature suggests that central bank
intervention is actually more effective when the central bank lies. In
that case, central banks <i>should</i> lie. </p>

<p>The question that needs to be addressed is whether lying by central
banks is a sustainable policy? A similar question has been asked in
the literature on monetary policy. It pertains to the credibility of
the central bank and its effectiveness in raising output and
employment. It has been observed that a central bank can be effective
only as long as it is credible. </p>

<p>In the case of the currency policy also, while lying may have
short-term benefits, it cannot be a sustainable policy. It leads to a
loss of credibility. In the case of monetary policy the cost of the
policy became clear when the US economy witnessed many years of
stagflation. Hopefully, the change in the case of the currency policy
will come about before a heavy price is paid.</p>
