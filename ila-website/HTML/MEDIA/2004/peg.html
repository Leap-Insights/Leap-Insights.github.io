<p>In a recent lecture, Larry Summers observed that the financial
crises of the 1980s were not situations where `innocent' countries
were somehow overwhelmed by a flood of capital from a `herd' of
speculators. They were, instead, situations in which countries made
very active efforts to "dine with the devil (speculators) and ended up
on the menu."</p>

<p>Larry Summers went on to make an important link between the problem
of short-term capital flows and `pegging' - the kind of currency
market manipulation that many central banks seem to like. He said that
the implicit exchange rate guarantee entailed in pegged exchange rates
formed a "particularly pernicious subsidy to short term capital."
These countries had actively invited short term capital flows.</p>

<p>In India, the RBI says that "in the long run", the rupee will
respond to fundamentals, but "in the short run", they will trade
actively to "control volatility". This means that if you are an FDI or
FII investor, with a five/ten year outlook on India, you have to bear
the full brunt of the currency risk on the rupee. But if you are a
short-term speculator, with a one-month horizon, you know that RBI is
there to protect you.</p>

<p>How big is this subsidy to short-term speculators? In a previous
article (Business Standard, February 18, 2004) I had estimated that in
2003-04 the cost of maintaining the rupee-dollar peg could work out to
roughly 1% of GDP or Rs.28,000 crore.</p>

<p>India faced a fork in the road recently. With the decision to issue
Rs.60,000 crore of Market Stabilization Bonds, the status quo on the
currency regime won. The step has given a clear signal to foreign
investors, who have been awaiting the outcome of the RBI's proposal to
MoF with bated breath. Thanks to this decision, the RBI can continue
to provide a low rupee-dollar volatility. Short-term capital flows can
enthusiastically get back to making money at the expense of the Indian
taxpayer.</p>

<p>The problem of currency regimes, pegging, short-term flows and the
fiscal costs of currency market manipulation are not new to
India. They have been amply studied through experiences of myriad
other countries. The consensus of this literature may be summarised as
follows.</p>

<p>The first key message is that pegged currency regimes are innately
vulnerable to speculation. People <i>will</i> make forecasts about the
future of the rupee, and they <i>will</i> act on these forecasts. We
are building up a large mass of short-term capital in the
country. This short-term capital is motivated by simple forecasting of
a "low volatility" exchange rate. This short-term capital has nothing
to do with India's glowing GDP growth. Last year, with low growth and
a bad monsoon, currency speculation was merrily generating capital
inflows.</p>

<p>There is an absolute certainty that the rupee will not appreciate
forever. At some point, expectations will turn. This turning point can
be triggered off by a wide variety of seemingly small shocks. Changes
in international money markets, changes in the domestic environment,
border conflicts, nuclear explosions, bad monsoons or any small shock
that change expectations can be the trigger. Shocks which would
normally have been absorbed by the economy, can become the cause of
large capital movements.  The elections will give us a fresh draw of
the cards, and for all we know, we could have a hung parliament which
suspends economic reforms.</p>

<p>Some trigger point will come. Overnight, the focus can shift from
India's growth potential to her internal debt trap. At that point, the
currency speculators will leave, and locals will move capital offshore
in speculating on a rupee depreciation.</p>

<p>At that point, RBI will claim that this massive hoard of reserves
is useful in coping with these cross-border capital movements. But it
is important to see that these short-term flows, and currency
speculation, are all caused by RBI's original sin of pegging to the
USD. This decision has given a hair-trigger vulnerability to the
macro-economy.</p>

<p>The next big lesson from the literature, on which there is a
complete consensus, is that sterilised intervention is an extremely
short term and fairly ineffective policy. As it invites further
inflows, it does not solve the problem of short term capital inflows
or the pressure on the currency. It has been observed that countries
that follow the policy of sterilised intervention see a change in the
composition of inflows in favour of short term inflows and away from
long term flows.</p>

<p>In India, RBI's policy of sterilised intervention is claimed to
ensure low currency volatility and low inflation. This offers an ideal
breeding ground for short term investors. What RBI also ensures, by
the sale of bonds in the domestic market, is that short term interest
rates remain high. In a normal market economy, inflows are
equilibriating since they would drive down local interest
rates. Sterilised intervention fights that equilibriating response of
the market, and lays a red carpet for continued short term
inflows.</p>

<p>Where are we headed? For a while, the inflows will continue, and
RBI will keep subsidising short term currency speculators without a
care about the fiscal costs. Another USD 20 billion could come in 3-6
months. We cannot say whether when Rs.60,000 crore is used up, will
Parliament continue to feed the elephant, or will the currency regime
change?</p>

<p>At some point, expectations will change, and there will be a sharp
reversal and pressure on the rupee to depreciate. The short-term
capital in the country will leave. The liberalisation of outflows of
recent months has generated many avenues for locals to shift capital
out of the country, to profit from a rupee depreciation. RBI will
`heroically battle the speculators', and peel reserves in addressing
the problem of its own making.</p>

<p>It could get worse. As in Jan 1998, there could be harsh efforts at
raising interest rates in `defending' the rupee. These could do damage
to the banking system, given the interest rate risk of poorly
regulated banks in India. There could be efforts to roll the clock
back on economic reforms, and go back to capital controls.</p>

<p>By signing on to the Market Stabilisation Bonds, Jaswant Singh has
signed on for this roller coaster. It is important to be very clear
that all this flows from one single policy mistake: a pegged
currency. If India did not peg to the USD, these problems would not
lie in store for us. We would not be wasting roughly 1% of GDP at a
time of acute fiscal stress, and running the risks of all these
destabilising events.</p>

<p>RBI has never explained what it is doing. Why is pegging optimal?
Why is it so important to reduce short-term volatility? Why is it good
to favour short-term speculators? What is the benefit for which we are
burning 1% of GDP at a time when we should be cutting the fiscal
deficit by 1% per year? This is the most non-transparent large expense
being paid for by the Indian taxpayer.</p>

<p> Jaswant Singh added the expenditure on MSBs to the exchequer after
his interim budget. He owes to the people a full explanation of the
costs and benefits of this policy.</p>
