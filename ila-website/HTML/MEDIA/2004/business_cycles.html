<p>Last week, the Conference Board of New York and the Singapore
Statistical Department organised a seminar in Singapore on the state
of economic indicators and business cycles in Asia. Participants from
China, India and ASEAN countries reported on the current state of
research in their countries.</p>

<p>The subject of business cycles in Asia has started attracting
attention. Asian growth is now the envy of the world, and an
increasing proportion of world GDP growth comes out of Asia. The Asian
crisis revealed the global impact of economic fluctuations in India.
So there is heightened interest in business cycles in Asia.</p>

<p>The biggest bottleneck to doing high quality work in this field is
that of the statistical system. In general, most of the data that is
used in OECD countries, for tracking and predicting business cycles,
is not even collected in poor countries.</p>

<p>For example, the most important series used to examine business
cycles in the US are monthly data for unemployment, hours worked, and
wages. None of this data exists in India. Unemployment data from the
NSS becomes available in India every five years. The latest year for
which data is now available is 1999-2000. And most scholars would
exercise caution in using NSS data to aggregate up to
macroeconomics.</p>

<p>More importantly, there are serious conceptual issues which come in
the way. An examination of the output series suggests that India has
witnessed six recessions in the last 50 years. But all the recessions
before the 1990s were a consequence of exogenous shocks. These were
mainly the failure of the rains which lead to a decline in output. In
the 1970s, the oil price shocks exacerbated the impact of bad
monsoons.</p>

<p>These ups and downs were driven by external shocks and not by
endogenous factors. As Victor Zarnowitz, one of the fathers of modern
business cycle research, pointed out in his keynote address, business
cycles are a phenomenon of modern industrial market economies. You do
not expect business cycles in medieval economies. In a market economy,
investment in plant, equipment and inventory is more prone to cyclical
behaviour than consumption. In general consumption is far smoother. As
the scale of investment is far larger in industrial economies, they
witness periods of over-investment and adjustment that create business
cycles. Cycles arise as investment decisions respond to changes in
aggregate demand.</p>

<p>Industry accounts for less than 25 percent of output in the Indian
GDP. In the pre-reform period a large share of this has been in the
public sector where investment decisions were driven more by the
planning process than by the market. In addition, because of the
industrial licensing regime, investment in new factories or even
expansion of existing capacity was not market driven. Other than
investment in inventories, investment in the formal industrial sector
was supply constrained.</p>

<p>It was only in the informal sector, which is the only truly free
market capitalism India has had for the last 50 years, that investment
decisions were highly responsive to the demand conditions in the
market. Apart from the informal sector, in most parts of the economy,
we did not have active decisions from year to year about investment and
about building up capacity. In this sense, it is
wrong to apply the word "business cycle" to the traditional ups and
downs of the Indian economy.</p>

<p>The liberalisation of the economy in the 1990s has changed all
this. We are now witnessing a much larger market driven investment
process. We are now seeing cycles in the buildup and drawdown of
inventory which look like those found in a market economy.</p>

<p>It is important to accept that all market economies witness
business cycles. The cycles may be long or short, but when growth
rates increase, at some point, the increase becomes unsustainable and
a slowdown sets in. While there is no doubt that the Indian economy
will be amongst the fastest growing economies in the world, there
should also be no doubt that this will not be growth at a steady,
unvarying rate. The economy will definitely witness growth rate cycles
(cycles in growth rates) even if there is no absolute decline in
output.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the period after 1993. At first, there was
great optimism. P/E ratios rose. Corporate earnings soared, and there
was an investment boom. After this phase, when the economy slowed,
firms initially cut investment, and built up inventory to avoid
disrupting production planning. After this, investment stayed at
resolutely low levels, while inventory drawdown took place. Losses
were experienced, and weak firms started dying. It is such ups and
downs that the industrial economies call "the business cycle".</p>

<p>In terms of data availability also the 1990s saw an
improvement. Once we think about the business cycle in terms of the
behaviour of <i>firms</i> of India, we can turn to exploiting the CMIE
database which gives us quarterly and annual time-series about the
firms of India. India fares well, when compared with other countries,
in the quality of this database. An analysis of the aggregate level of
sales, profits, investment and gross value added of all companies
reveals behviour similar to that observed in industrial market
economies. This
<i>micro</i> data is thus a valuable new resource for understanding Indian
macroeconomics.</p>

<p>The Indian economy is not only increasingly driven by domestic
market forces, it is also getting more and more integrated into the
world economy. Today exports of goods alone are over 10 percent of
GDP, and services exports are also substantial. As Pami Dua has
demonstrated, the performance of Indian exports depends on the
business cycle of developed countries. As a result we should expect to
see business cycles in US and the rest of the world getting
transmitted to India. </p>

<p>This perspective has major implications for macro policy making in
India. Until now the main objective of fiscal and monetary policy in
India was to push growth. With the expectation of far greater cyclical
behaviour in the economy, we need to learn to do counter-cyclical
fiscal and monetary policy.</p>

<p>A government with its back against the wall in terms of fiscal
problems will endup exacerbating the business cycle. What is needed is
to spend more and earn less in a bad year. Instead, a fiscally
strapped government will spend more in a good year (like 2003-04) when
faced with buoyant tax revenues and less in a bad year (like
2002-03). This aspect is a powerful reason in favour of fiscal
consolidation, so as to set the stage for a potent counter-cyclical
fiscal policy.</p>

<p>The success of counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policies in the
US in recent years has also heightened awareness of the need for an
independent monetary policy. In recent years, India has considerably
given up monetary policy autonomy in favour of currency market
manipulation. This tradeoff needs to be questioned in the light of the
role that is desirable for monetary policy in managing the business
cycle. </p>

<p>Finally, both fiscal and monetary policy can be effective in
smoothing business cycles when policy makers have better information
and analysis of business cycles in India. While there has been some
research in this field in India such as at NCAER, RBI and DSE, it is
still in its incepient stages. For more effective policy making there
is a need for improving collection of data, monitoring and analysis of
the emerging cyclical behaviour of the Indian economy.</p>
