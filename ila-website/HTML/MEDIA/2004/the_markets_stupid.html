<p>When the NDA seemed to be coasting to victory, Nifty was at
1900. On Monday, Nifty closed at 1400. This was an astonishing loss of
26%, or over Rs.3 trillion of market capitalisation. The losses were
sharpest with PSUs, including PSU banks.</p>

<p>There are some who think this the stock market is irrelevant. But
it helps to think carefully about what we now face. The Congress
manifesto itself betrays fairly bad economic policy. In addition,
there are signs that a resurgent left may have an impact on economic
policy.</p>

<p>After a difficult first year, the NDA had conquered their demons of
the SJM and the RSS in terms of economic policy. Will Sonia be able to
bring the left under heel, the way Vajpayee was able to silence his
band? Will Sonia be able to match Vajpayee's economic policies? The
markets think not.</p>

<p>However, even putting the problems of a soft-headed Congress and a
rather over vocal left together, is it reasonable to think that the
companies of India are now worth 26% less than they were two months
ago, when the NDA was in charge? It does seem like an unusually large
adjustment. The markets seem to have a lot of faith in the ability of
the left to do damage.</p>

<p>Manmohan Singh once famously commented that he did not worry about
the ups and downs of the market. The left has now tried to dismiss the
markets as being irrelevant. This may have been okay fifteen years
ago, when the markets were much smaller. Today, the equity market
capitalisation is in the same league as total bank deposits, and the
financial markets are the veritable commanding heights of the
economy.</p>

<p>This drop in stock prices has real consequences. Two major channels
of influence can be identified. The first is the "wealth
effect". People in the country are Rs.3 trillion poorer. This will
prompt them to spend less; to postpone buying things. This will have a
contractionary effect on the economy.</p>

<p>The second is the impact on investment. The stock market is a
forward looking forecaster of the economy, and directs flows of
capital based on views about the future. Lower stock prices correspond
to higher cost of capital. Less money will go into startups; fewer
IPOs will happen; listed companies will invest less; less foreign
capital will flow into the country.</p>

<p>India now has over twenty years of steadily accelerating growth,
from 1979 onwards. It is not possible to now drop back to stagnant or
dropping growth rates. In the street, there is now a revolution of
rising expectations. If the Congress has any hope of winning the next
elections, they have to deliver on higher economic growth; they need
to get trend economic growth up from 6.3% to 7.3%. There could not
have been a more unhappy beginning to their five years than the 26%
drop in stock prices.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the problem of fiscal consolidation. It
will be impossible to achieve FRBM targets with slower economic
growth. If a Congress government gets average growth down from 6.3% to
5.3%, then India will surely not execute a serious fiscal
consolidation, we will be in an explosive debt trap, and Sonia Gandhi
will be remembered as the person who trashed India's economy.</p>

<p>In terms of political economy, the stock market crash has roused a
powerful constituency in favour of economic reforms - the people who
lost Rs.3 trillion. As with Maggie Thatcher's popular
privatisations, the NDA had done well to disperse ownership of PSU
shares into millions of households. These households have all suffered
huge losses, and they blame the ignorant mouths of the left.</p>

<p>At the other end, think of the Ambani family. The Reliance group
companies had a market capitalisation of roughly Rs.100,000 crore and
the family owns perhaps half of this. The Ambani family has thus taken
a hit of something like Rs.13,000 crore. Ouch!  </p>

<p>This experience has been a powerful and salutary reminder to the
Congress and the left about their populist rhetoric. As we know from
looking at vote shares, their populism did not give them more
votes. And as the stock market has powerfully warned, their populism
will endanger growth if it is allowed to turn into economic
policy. The Congress and the left must remember that they are no
longer banking on a planned economy to deliver growth. They are
depending on the markets and on incentives. And, therefore, they can
no longer choose to ignore markets. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton faced similar challenges when he first came into
power, with an ambitious reformist agenda in terms of many aspects of
how government functions. But he was crystal clear about the
importance of the bond market. Robert Rubin was brought in to reassure
the markets, and "the bond market" was given veto powers on every
major policy announcement. Clinton was very clear that he could not
execute on his social agenda without first passing the test of the
markets.</p>

<p>Sonia Gandhi now faces that very test. The market has served a
timely warning: If she chooses the wrong FM, or if the Common Minimum
Programme is a throwback to economics of the 1970s, then things will
go very wrong in terms of economic growth.</p>

<p>To get five good years, and for Congress to get re-established as a
party that delivers results, growth has to accelerate from 6.3% to
7.3%. Only if Sonia can get that package together, can she deliver the
promise of growth with a human face. </p>

<p>To those who are unhappy about this stock market response, it will
help to think about what things would have been like without the stock
market. The markets have done well to serve notice. The market is
pointing to a need to discipline the left.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the Congress would have done many things
differently, even without the influence of the left. For example, the
sale of profit making PSUs was not in the Congress manifesto. Labour
reforms were not on the anvil, even with the NDA. India is hardly
going to get out of the WTO and implement QRs again. However, the
rhetoric of the left <i>is</i> scaring the market. That rhetoric needs
to be contained by Sonia Gandhi so that market expectations do not
become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>What can Sonia Gandhi do to decisively gain confidence, and
kickstart a constructive focus on the economy?</p>

<ol>
<li> Manmohan Singh should be quickly announced as the next FM.

<li>Twenty disinvestment/privatisation transactions, of atleast
Rs.200 crore each, should be put through in the first month of the new
government. There is plenty of opportunity, in GOI's vast holdings of
various companies, to do deals that draw on West Bengal's
privatisation strategy of "joint venture collaborations". 

  <li> The Ministry of Finance should get to work on policy, and
release a stream of documents into the public, so that discussion and
debate on those will replace speculation about what the left might do.
