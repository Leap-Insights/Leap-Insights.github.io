    Stock-ing up: How to buy, sell shares 
</h1>

<HR>

<p><b>Why should I care about buying or selling shares on the stock market? </b></p>

<p>One possibility is that you are a long-term investor. For instance, you could be 35 years old, putting money aside for your retirement. In this case, you should care about the stock market because diversified equity portfolios are likely to give you the best returns over long horizons. In order to do this, you would regularly buy shares, build up a diversified portfolio of shares, and watch your portfolio gain value over the decades. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could have a great deal of knowledge about companies, and participate in the speculative processes of the market. When news breaks, various people buy or sell shares, depending on whether they expect share prices to go up or down. In this case, you are an active trader, and you run a much bigger risk of losing money. </p>

<p><b>THE BASICS</b></p>

<p><b>How do I buy shares on the stock market? </b></p>

<p>You have to go to a stock broker — who is authorised by the stock exchange — and place an order. Your order to him may be: ‘‘I want to buy 100 shares of Infosys’’. For this order to be executed, a seller is required. If a seller is found on the system, the order is ‘‘matched’’ and becomes a ‘‘trade’’. Then you have to pay money and you get the shares.</p>

<p><b>When I buy shares, how do I know I am getting the best price? </b></p>

<p>There are two exchanges — NSE and BSE. Both operate a 100% computerised market, where orders from across the country go into computer systems. When you place a buy order, you are guaranteed (by the computer) that you are matching the lowest price from across the country. When you place a sell order, you are guaranteed (by the computer) that you are matching the highest price from across the country. </p>


<p>In old fashioned markets, you had to waste time ‘‘shopping around’’ and find the lowest price to buy. When you actually buy onions from any one shop, you are never sure you have got the best price in the country. Computers are best at ‘‘shopping around’’. When you buy or sell shares on NSE or BSE, thanks to ‘‘computerised order matching’’, you are sure that you have the best price available from anyone else in the country. This is a source of efficiency and peace of mind. </p>

<p><b>Will I find a buyer if I need to sell? </b></p>

<p>On average, NSE does roughly 1.5 million trades a day and BSE does roughly 1 million trades a day. These are very big numbers: NSE is the world’s 3rd largest exchange (by this measure) and BSE is the 5th largest in the world. If India plays its cards right, within a few years, we may expect to see NSE and BSE at the top of the global list. </p>

<p>Put together, NSE and BSE are doing 2.5 million trades every day. The trading day runs from 10 am to 3:30 pm. This works out to an average of roughly 125 trades per second during trading time. This is why stock market trading screens are always buzzing. For the top 1500 stocks in the country, if you need to sell in a hurry, you will always find a buyer. </p>

<p><b>SETTLEMENT PROCESSES </b></p>

<p><b>What is ‘‘the spot market’’? </b></p>

<p>There are two steps in every trade: agreeing on the terms, and then completing the ‘‘settlement’’, where money and securities change hands. If the settlement takes place fairly soon after the trade, then it is called a ‘‘spot market’’. If you go up to a store, put down money, and eat a sandwich, that’s a spot market. If you put down money to ‘‘book a car’’ which is delivered to you some weeks in the future, that is not a spot market.</p>

<p><b>When does settlement take place? </b></p>

<p>The stock market operates on what is called ‘‘T+2’’ settlement. That means that money and securities change hands on the 2nd working day after the trade date. For example, if you buy on Monday, your broker has to send money in on Wednesday, and the shares show up on Wednesday. This procedure is called ‘‘rolling settlement’’. </p>

<p><b>If I suddenly need money, for example for a hospitalisation, how quickly can securities be converted into money?</b></p>

<p>Two working days after you sell shares. Selling shares on Friday yields money on Tuesday. Many stockbrokers will give you a service of ‘‘instant cash’’ at a slight discount. That is, if you sell shares worth Rs 100 on Friday, and the money is normally expected on Tuesday, they might give you Rs 99.6 on Friday itself. </p>

<p><b>Should we move on to T+1 settlement? </b></p>

<p>India is already ahead of the world in terms of being at T+2 settlement. For example, in New York, T+3 settlement is used, which means that they have to wait one extra day (compared to India) in order to get money for shares sold. </p>

<p>One major factor which has held back the move to T+1 is the weak banking system. While India’s stock markets are world class, the banks are a few decades behind the world in their inability to swiftly move money across the country. The recently launched ‘‘Realtime Gross Settlement’’ (RTGS) system will provide a backbone through which banks will be able to offer better services. But this story is still some years in the future. </b></p>
