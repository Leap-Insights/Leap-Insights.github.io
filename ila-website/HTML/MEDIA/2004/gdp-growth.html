<h1> What next with GDP growth?</h1>
<p><i><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/what-next-with-gdp-growth-104012101007_1.html" style="text-decorating:none" >Business standard</a></i>, 21 January 2004</p>  
<hr>
<p>There is a lot of excitement about high GDP growth in
2003-04. Growth in the 2nd quarter was 8.4%. CMIE recently upgraded
their estimate for growth in 2003-04 from 7.4% to 8.2%. <br>
</p>
<p>There is an undeniable magic in getting above 7.5% - it upgrades
India's standing in the world, and improves investor confidence. More
good news is in the offing. The corporate results that will come out
in coming months are also likely to show strong growth rates of
revenues and profits. Jaswant Singh has said that the next two
quarters will also show growth above 8%.</p>
<p>Is this growth simply a low base effect? With the drought last year,
growth dropped
to 4.3%. Suppose this year had merely been a return to the trend
growth rate of 6%. Then we should have got growth of 7.7%. We
seem to be faring a bit better than this.</p>
<p><i>What does 2004-05 hold?</i> India has had
only one episode in history, where growth in consecutive years was
above 7%: This was in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97, where growth was
7.25%, 7.34% and 7.84%. Apart from this, there has never been a pair
of consecutive years above 7%. So the interesting question is: <i>will
2004-05 be different?</i></p>
<p>There are positive and negative consequences of the very good
monsoon in 2003-04. Some of the GDP impact of this monsoon will show
up in 2004-05. But at the same time, it is unlikely that we will get
high agricultural growth next year. High growth in 2004-05
<i>requires</i> very strong growth in industry.</p>
<p>What was the magic that worked from 1994-95 to 1996-97? It was an
investment boom, triggered by the reforms of the early 1990s. Economic
reforms triggered optimistic <i>expectations</i>, which led to
investment. The investment <i>decisions</i> made by companies in 1993
and 1994 had a delayed impact on investment and GDP growth, which
showed up from 1994 onwards.</p>
In the present feel-good scenario, expectations are high. It is
possible that we could see a strong growth in
investment which could push up GDP growth in
2004-05 to above 7%. In a number of ways the economy is better equipped
to handle an improved investment climate. A large number of bottlenecks
that existed in the mid-1990s have today been eased. While expectations
in the 1990s were based more on hope today they are based far more on
hard reality, an improved infrastructure, a better understanding of the
potential and the constraints that exist in the economy today.
Companies are much better prepared today to take on competition and
have effectively improved efficiency in the last few years. <br>
<br>
Another big difference from the 1990s is the drop in customs
tariffs. Low tariffs reduce uncertainty about future difficulties
caused by tariff reductions, and encourage investment. Every investor
in India in the early 1990s had a damocles sword over his head, about
what would happen when India opened up. Things are much better now. At
the same time, it is important to point out that what India claims is
a `peak' rate is a white lie. The true peak rate is enormously
higher.
<br>
<p>As with the early 1990s, the stock market is booming. High stock
prices are necessary for sending out signals to firms to invest. When
the price to book ratio is 2, this means that Rs.1 of investment turns
into Rs.2 of wealth. This is likely to give substantial resource
mobilisation on the primary market. If a string of IPOs come about,
which appears likely, then many venture capital firms will obtain
profits by selling off their bets of the 1990s. This will (in turn)
generate a fresh set of VC investments in young companies.</p>
<p>A useful difference from the early 1990s is the demise of DFIs,
the downsizing of UTI and improvements in banking regulation. This
should reduce the incidence of incompetent decisions by
banks, as happened in the 1990s and as has happened in China. On the
securities markets, infrastructure has improved dramatically. In the
early 1990s, when FII investment rose sharply, inflows choked owing to
the difficulties in handling physical paper. In 2003, a similar sharp
rise in FII investment was competently handled by the securities
infrastructure.<br>
</p>
<p>Large investments that are
required in infrastructure seem far more possible today than they have
been in the past. For the first time, it now seems that the
regulatory and policy impediments have been significantly addressed in
four areas (roads, telecom, ports, electricity). Large investments in
airports also appear likely. These could help ignite new projects that
were held back by poor facilities. Only railways have
been largely untouched by the reforms process, and there is no
possibility of obtaining a sharp rise in investment in railways.<br>
</p>
<p>For example, we have long talked about the need to dramaically grow
teledensity. Now, for the first time, we are at a point where 100
million lines will realistically be added in two years, and this
innately implies
certain investment flows will take place. Similarly, investments in
the electricity sector may grow dramatically owing to the
Electricity Act. Given the right investment climate, there could
easily be Rs.100,000 crore of investment in these areas in
2004-05. This would be a good foundation of an investment boom.<br>
</p>
<p>FDI is another area which fits this general pattern. Ten years ago,
when global companies woke up to the importance of India, they faced a
quagmire of difficult procedures, which converted optimistic investment
intentions into a trickle. Ten years later, India is once again high on
the radar of global companies, and when they make decisions to build
operations in India, the FDI framework that we have has experienced one
decade of criticism and improvement.<br>
</p>
<p>This adds up to a picture where considerable investment demand could
come about, which could give high growth in 2004-05. However, in
addition to all these strengths, there are things that
could go wrong. In 2004-05, we could have
a bad monsoon. Fiscal stress, given the
failures on fiscal reforms such as state VAT and removal of
exemptions, could impact public services in a number of states. RBI
could hit a rough patch, and we could have trouble out
of the inherent tensions in the combination of the currency market,
the bond market, and the interest rate risk of banks.<br>
</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a serious possibility of
extremely good outcomes shaping up. The central issue is investment
demand: if capital goods expenditures grow well in 2004, then
we can be on course for high GDP growth in 2004-05. There are signs
that
this could happen. <br>
