<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The
merger of the DA with basic salary is worrying because of its fiscal
implications. The current merger of 50 percent DA with basic pay
implies that a current basic salary of Rs.20,000 with 59 percent DA
will be raised to Rs.30,000 with 9 percent DA on the basic. This way
the government will, in future, be paying a DA on what is today's DA.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Moreover,
an increase in basic pay leads to an increase in pension liabilities
and to other components of salary that are linked to the basic pay.
In the case of defence a large number of allowances are linked to the
basic pay. The move is therefore expected to have a large impact on
defence spending. Further, the change in salary structure of central
government employees normally permeates to other institutions such as
universities and to states. </FONT>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Some
estimates suggest that this step will raise central government salary
expenditure by Rs.4000 crore. Taking into account the total impact
for states, salary spending is expected to rise by about Rs.15,000
crore. Thus, unless the government intends to cut staff, it is going
to pay out an additional 0.5 per cent of GDP as salary to it
employees. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>We
have seen earlier that while the government implemented the
recommendations of the fifth pay commission regarding salaries, it
did not go ahead with the downsizing of its staff as recommended.
This played havoc with central and state budgets. Capital expenditure
compression occurred as a result of the increase in revenue
expenditure. </FONT>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is often argued that the rising fiscal deficit limits the ability of
the government to invest in infrastructure. Today the issue is not
only that of public investment. Certainly, infrastructure continues
to suffer because of lack of public resources. Today the provision of
basic public goods such as law and order, primary education, health
and drinking water is at stake. The Delhi government talks about
public-private <I>bhagyadari</I> in provision of public safety.
States like Bihar find it difficult to pay policemen their salaries.
When interest payments on past borrowing eat up more than half of tax
collections, governments start losing the ability to govern. </FONT>
