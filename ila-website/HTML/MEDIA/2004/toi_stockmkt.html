<p>The stock market has moved very sharply in the last few days in the
days when there was uncertainty about election results and economic
policies. This has left many people wondering whether the market has
any clue about how the economy is going to behave? </p>

<p>Many people think that financial markets are some kind of casino,
that the ups and the downs of financial markets are irrelevant. It is
remarkable to see a large number of people, including (strangely
enough) market professionals who hold this kind of view.</p>

<p>From the 1960s onwards, the economics profession has increasingly
veered towards a very different view of markets. Professional
economists think that market prices reflect expectations about the
economy's performance. Stock markets tend to be buoyant when the
economy is expected to do well. This has been seen both since the
nineties in India, and in stock markets abroad.</p>

<p>The price of a company's stock responds both to news about the
company and about the economy in general. The market index, a weighted
average of the share price of the most traded companies, reflects
expectations about the behaviour of the economy as a whole. The index
is a diversified portfolio. It includes companies such as oil
companies, banks, software companies, etc. and is not sector
specific. The only systematic factor in the fluctuations of the index
is the outlook for the overall economy.</p>

<p>The stock market is a remarkably good forecaster. For example, in
the early 1990s, stock prices rose sharply - in anticipation of a
doubling of profit in 1994 and another doubling of profit in
1995. From late 1994 onwards, stock prices did badly. This was in
anticipation of big declines in profit: -38\%, -22\% and -50\% from
1996-97 to 1998-99.</p>

<p>Similarly, in 2002-03 and 2003-04, profits grew sharply, and the
stock market captured this in prices ahead of events. Any economist who
made such forecasts would be extremely proud of his abilities. </p>

<p>In recent days, the irresponsible statements made by the left were
the most damaging for the oil companies and for PSU banks. A lack of
progress in privatisation of these companies bodes ill for their
future profit growth, since they will continue to be subject to poor
management and government interference. Hence, this turn of events led
to the sharpest drop in stock prices of these companies.</p>

<p>Why does the market work so well? In the Indian stock market 92
percent of the trading volume is accounted for by individual
retailers. Only 8 percent are the FIIs, FIs and mutual funds who hire
professionals. The foundation of the market is information processing
and forecasting efforts of speculators. Recently, Hindustan Lever hit
a wall in terms of failing to obtain growth in profits. A speculator
who had correctly anticipated this event, ahead of time, would have
profited enormously when the bad results of HLL actually came out.</P>

<p>Unlike the employees of banks or mutual funds, individual
speculators are extremely well motivated since they work for
themselves. They put their own money on the line when they take
positions on the market. This gives them good incentives to study
companies and the economy, make forecasts, and place their bets. It is
an amazing systems of side bets about what will happen next.</p>
