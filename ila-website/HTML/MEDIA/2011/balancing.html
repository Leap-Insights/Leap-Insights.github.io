  Three balancing acts

<p>The world economy went through a surprisingly easy recovery in
2010. However, the deeper economic problems did not get solved that
easily. The outlook for the world economy is now once again
gloomy. Indian policy makers need to understand where the risks to the
Indian economy lie and have action plans ready in case a crisis
recurs.</p>

<p>When the global crisis erupted in late 2008, policy makers
worldwide were very conscious that this was the biggest economic
crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The collapse in
financial firms and markets served as an early warning system; the
policy responses came early. Governments used monetary policy and
fiscal policy to the utmost extent possible. The short-term response
was surprisingly good. World GDP growth bounced back from -0.7% in
2009 to +5.1% in 2010. </p>

<p>At a deeper level, though, the fundamental macroeconomic problems
did not get resolved. Frail financial firms were rescued by
governments, but many governments then became frail. These problems
particularly erupted in the countries in Europe with big welfare
programs, high indebtedness, and the political inability to close down
welfare programs.</p>

<p>The short-term fiscal stimulus had to fade away, and get replaced
by higher private demand. But the citizenry understood that higher
taxes were coming, and that the world was a difficult place, and
responded by saving more. The handover from public to private demand
has thus stalled. </p>

<p>One fundamental element of the required adjustment -- reduction in
the US current account deficit and in the Chinese current account
surplus -- has not begun. The US Senate has now passed legislation
that could punish China for its alleged currency manipulation. The
Bill still has to go to Congress and is creating concerns about trade
wars if the US decides that China is manipulating its currency and
imposes tariffs on Chinese products. </p>

<p>High growth is the goal of policy makers from the viewpoint of the
welfare of the citizens. But in a peculiar way, slow growth is an
important problem in itself. The world economy is suffering from two
vicious cycles right now, each of which is critically driven by slow
growth. </p>

<p>The first vicious cycle is about the fiscal situation. When GDP
grows well, the debt/GDP ratio becomes modest. Conversely, when GDP
growth slows, the debt/GDP ratio ratchets up harshly. Slow growth is
inducing fiscal distress. Governments have to pull back, with fiscal
tightening, but if they do this too harshly, then this will damage
growth. </p>

<p>The second vicious cycle has to do with bank fragility. Slow growth
is hurting bank balance sheets. But if banks pull back on lending too
much this will damage growth. </p>

<p>The IMF's <i>World Economic Outlook</i> has projected 4% growth in
2011 and 2012. This would be a small reduction compared with the 5.1%
growth of 2010. There are two problems with this benign picture. The
first is the high uncertainty: growth in 2012 will range from 1.5% to
6.2% with a 90% confidence. The second problem is that this projection
is rooted on things going well. It assumes that the Euro crisis will
subside, that the US makes progress on fiscal consolidation and that
no new hiccups will surface in finance. If even one of these three
elements falters, global growth in 2012 will work out significantly
worse than 4%.</p>

<p>Of particular importance to India is trade growth. Indian exports
growth has only a weak link with the INR/USD exchange rate; it has a
strong link with world trade growth. In 2009, world trade dropped by
10.7%. It bounced back to +12.8% growth in 2010. The IMF WEO projects
growth of 5.8% in 2012. This suggests that Indian exports growth will
slow down in 2012. </p>

<p>The IMF estimates the probability of a financial crisis on each of
the G-20 countries. The top six countries and their crisis
probabilities are: Turkey (7.6%), Indonesia (4.8%), South Africa
(3.5%), Brazil (3.3%), Italy (2.8%) and then India (2.4%). While we
are immersed in our domestic crisis of governance of the UPA-II
administration, we should also take heed of this. We are only a bit
safer than Italy. </p>

<p>The global recovery hinges on three delicate balancing acts. First,
OECD countries need to find the middle ground between gaining fiscal
credibility while avoiding drastic actions which choke the
recovery. The most important element of this is the scaling back of
welfare programs. This bolsters long-term fiscal credibility by
boosting long-term growth, while inducing only small shocks to the
economy in the short term.</p>

<p>The second balancing act is that of financial firms putting more
equity capital on their balance sheets. More equity capital is
undoubtedly required, but this process cannot be rushed: pulling back
on credit would choke the recovery.</p>

<p>The third balancing act is that of the Chinese current account
surplus. China needs to appreciate the currency, and undertake many
other policy moves that reduce the investment binge. At the same time,
drastic actions need to be avoided, which would plunge the Chinese
economy into a recession. There is no sign so far of progress on
this. If anything, there is some evidence that the gradual
appreciation of the Chinese yuan stalled in mid August. </p>

<p>While global policy makers should worry about delicately solving
these three balancing acts, we in India should worry that conditions
in the world economy are not promising, and focus on our own economic
problems. There could not be a worse time for domestic policy making
to be in disarray. Decaying growth momentum will exacerbate fiscal
distress. The absence of economic reform is damaging optimism and
investment.</p>

<p>At the same time higher inflationary expectations are feeding back
into inflation. With a central bank that lacks commitment and
credibility for inflation control, India coud well be headed towards
not just slower growth, but many months of stagflation. We are
ill-prepared for a crisis in global financial markets, that could make
this worse.</p>
