<h1>
  Cannot trust that IIP data
</h1>

<p><i><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/cant-trust-that-iip-data/751903/" style="text-decorating:none" >Financial Express</a></i>, 19 February 2011</p>
<HR>

<p>The sharp drop in the growth rate of IIP should be viewed with caution. The index rose by a mere 1.6 percent compared to December 2009. The sharp slowdown has raised questions about the need for fiscal and monetary consolidation. There are two issues to consider. First, that the data may not reflect actual production, given that the production basket has weights from 1993-94, which excludes some of the items that have a large share in production today. Second, the slowdown in IIP has come from a decline in capital goods production, which suggests that investment activity is down. </p>

<p>Table 1 below shows how various components of IIP grew in December 2010, both in sectoral and use based terms. It shows that 		capital goods were the worst hit and fell by more than 13 percent. This decline is a serious cause for concern in any economy 			since it gives an indication about investment plans in the economy. </p>

<p>Figure 1, however, shows that capital goods growth has been very volatile over the last two years. This has increased the 			volatility of IIP. There appear to be some issues of coverage. The first problem with the IIP data has been its coverage. The 			episode of very sharp growth in July 2010 brought this to attention. In July 2010 IIP growth was reported to be 15 percent. The 		output of machinery grew by 49 percent. Within machinery the production of "insulated wires and cables" grew by 518 percent. 			This pulled up IIP sharply. Added to this was a 57 percent increase in the production of PVC pipes and tubes. </p> 
	
<p>Similarly, in 2009-10 measured by IIP the growth in the machinery sector at 21 percent. However, when we compare this number 		to the sales revenues of corporates in this sector from CMIE's Prowess database, we find that revenues grew by only 2.6 percent. 		This suggests a discrepency. Data from CMIE suggests that in the machinery sector companies which manufacture wind turbines and 		internal combustion engines took a big beating. These items are, however, not included in the IIP since IIP has an old base. 			Similarly, IIP for rubber, plastic, petroleum and coal products reported a 15 percent rise in 2009-10. However, sales revenues 			from these companies declined by 2.5 percent during that year. The 15 percent rise was from PVC pipes, giant pripes and tubes 			and rubber tyres. </p>	
		
<p>Table 2 shows where the growth in fell in capital goods. A sharp decline of more than 60 percent is seen in ship building and 		repair. Similarly the production of computer systems, cooling towers, agricultural implements, insultated cables and wires, 			dumpers, turbines, industrial machinery, furnaces, wagons, diamond and machine toods, electric generators, lifts and 			transformers actually declined. Textile machinery saw no increase in prodction compared to last year. A number of other 		equipment saw very low growth. If the above data is correct, it is very difficult to reconcile it with the growth in sales of 			companies in this sector. </p>

<p>The CSO proposes to bring out the new IIP with 2004-05 as the base year soon. This should be done with utmost urgency so that 		good data can guide policy decisions in these uncertain times. </p>
