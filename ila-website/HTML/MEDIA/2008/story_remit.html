hspace="20" vspace="20"/>Indians living abroad send dollars into India
in two ways. One, through NRI deposits, and second, and more
importantly, through private transfers. Private transfers, also called
remittances, which show up on the current account of the balance of
payments, have witnessed a sudden increase in recent months. Private
transfers coming into India between July to September 2007 were USD
10.1 billion. Inflows on account of net private transfers were next in
magnitude to net inflows due to the portfolio investments by FIIs
which were only slightly higher than private transfers at USD 10.9
billion. Private transfers generally consist of money sent by Indian
workers to their families in India. </p>

<p>Even in the past, the contribution of the Indian diaspora to
dollars flowing into India has been very large. While NRI deposits
have been much smaller, net private transfers have been huge. As FIG 1
shows what Indians abroad send to their families back home is very
large compared to the net capital flows that foreigners bring in,
which are the focus of Indian debates on convertibility and monetary
policy. In 2006, for example, dollar inflow into India on account of
private remittances was USD 24 billion. Net capital flows on account
of FII, FDI, debt and other flows added up to only a slightly higher
number of USD 25 billion. </p>

<p>Last year, in 2006-07, the Indian diaspora sent in remittances
worth USD 28 billion dollars. This financial year, between April and
September 2007, they had already sent in USD 25 billion into India. In
a survey of NRI remittances, the RBI is reported to have found that
nearly half the money sent from abroad is spent by families while the
rest is either parked in bank deposits or used to purchases shares and
property. The biggest flow of remittance into India, which is the
largest receipient of remittances in the world today, now comes from
the United States. The latest available data shows that about 44
percent of remittances comes from North America and another 32 percent
from the Middle East. </p>

<p>What has prompted the sudden sharp increase in remittances in the recent period? </p>

<p><img style="float: right" src="fig2_remittances_differential.jpg"
width="480" hspace="20" vspace="20"/>Figure 2 suggests that periods
when the interest rate in India is higher than the interest rate in
the US, i.e. when the interest differential is high, are the times
when remittances go up. This hypothesis is not inconsistent with the
view that nearly half the inflows are invested to earn returns in the
domestic market. </p>

<p>In BOP data, remittances are counted as a current account
entry. However, they constitute one important element of India's
capital account openness. With the massive interest rate differential
that has opened up, one brother can borrow $100,000 in the US, and
send this money to a brother in India, who would earn a premium of 6
percentage points. This gives an easy profit of Rs.240,000 over a
year. Millions of households could do this. While it is easily
understood that capital flows such as debt flows and external
commercial borrowing would move sharply with changes in interest
differntials, this story has not been so obvious for private transfers
in earlier years. However, increasingly as private transfers are
coming from the US and from higher income families and are meant not
just for family maintenance, but also for finanacial investment by
families, the nature of these transfers appears to be chaning. Since
the amount of transfers is a very large amount compared to the dollars
that flow into India through different categories of the capital
account, they offers an opportunity for money to be moved in and out
of the country. </p>
