  Engineering of the rupee

<p> <img style="float: right" src="FIGURE1.jpg" width="480"
hspace="20" v\ space="20"/> February saw the US dollar weaken against
world currencies. It fell against most major currencies in the world
including the Euro, the British Pound and the Japanese Yen. This would
have led us expect that the Indian rupee would also appreciate against
the US dollar. But this is not what happened. February 2008 saw the
Indian rupee depreciate. Does this suggest a reversal of the direction
in the rupee will move? Have dollar inflows into India gone down and
that is why the rupee is depreciating? A look at the data suggests
that the pressure on the rupee to appreciate is as strong as
ever. </p>

<p>What does the data tell us? If the depreciation of the rupee had
been due to an outflow of capital putting pressure on the rupee to
depreciate, there would have been either no change in the foreign
exchange reserves held by the RBI (other than a small
valuation/interest accrual change) or foreign exchange reserves should
have declined as the RBI fought off the sudden pressure to ensure a
smooth rupee. </p>

<p>However, data from the RBI suggests quite the opposite. There was a
sharp increase in the foreign exchange reserves of the RBI. In the
month of February reserves increased by 11.7 billion dollars. In the
first two months of 2008, foreign exchange reserves have already
increased by USD 25 billion. In other words, this suggests that the
depreciation of the rupee was engineered. </p>

<p>After the cut in interest rates in the US since mid-2007, there has
been a sharp increase in the interest differentials with India. This
could be expected to lead to a sharp inflow of capital into India and
a rupee appreciation. </p>

<p>How then did the rupee depreciate in February? Theq RBI has
intervened not only as it normally does in the spot market, but also
in forward markets. Keeping the rupee above Rs 39 per dollar has
clearly been a big battle. This is visible from the large amounts of
intervention that the RBI has undertaken in the last few months. Table
1 shows RBI's purchases in the dollar market. Between September and
December RBI bought a total of USD 55.7 billion in both the spot and
forward markets. </p>

<p>RBI will release foreign exchange market intervention data for
January and February with a lag. What we have today, however, is data
on changes in foreign exchange reserves. Foreign exchange reserves
rose by 12.7 billion in January 2008, and by 11.7 billion in February
2008. Given the large spot purchases it would not be surprising to see
that RBI also used the forward market to push the rupee down. </p>


<p>But why go all the way to pushing the rupee to depreciate? One
possible answer is that too much money is coming in trying to take
advantage of the one way bet and the interest differentials with
respect to the US. There was money to be made by borrowing in the US
and lending in India. Interest rates in India are higher and if the
rupee was also going to get stronger, dollar returns would be even
higher. In this situation the RBI might have tried to break the
one-way bet by pushing the rupee to depreciate. While the rupee
movement may fool some people for some time into thinking that there
will be a depreciation, smarter market participants will not be fooled
for long. Everyone is aware that this pace of intervention is
unsustainable. Embarking on strategies like intervening in forward
markets reveals the RBI's desperation. It builds up even stronger
expectations that at some point, when too much pressure builds up, the
RBI will have to let go. </p>

<p>In summary, while the rupee did depreciate in February, it did so
on the back of trading by RBI and not market forces. This is a poor
path in economic policy. There is a market distortion where the price
of the rupee is too low. Easing this distortion requires a rupee
appreciation. An artificial depreciation of the rupee is a step in the
wrong direction. Intuitively, it is as awkward as a decision by the
Ministry of Petroleum to cut the price of petrol when the world price
of oil is rising. </p>


<p>Moreover, a rupee depreciation is inflationary. It is not a
credible stance of monetary policy because it is politically
incompatible with impending elections. It is obvious to market
participants that this is an unsustainable policy. The profits from
betting on rupee appreciation, as seen for capital coming into the
country, are now bigger. With a combination of a large interest rate
differential and a large distortion in the rupee, foreign capital now
sees India as an extremely attractive opportunity to make a profit by
exploiting the mistakes of monetary policy.</p>
