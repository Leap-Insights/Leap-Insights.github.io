<P>Objectives :  The course aims to provide tools for understanding the implications of policy changes, shocks and disturbances in the international economy. The first part of the course will be devoted to international finance. The second part of the course will focus on theory of international trade. The third part of the course will deal with trade and exchange rate policy in India. </P>
<P>The course would be structured such that part three or the Indian experience will also be woven into the first two parts. Having taught the basic theory, applications will be both from international and Indian experience. The course will be taught primarily in the form of lectures. </P>
