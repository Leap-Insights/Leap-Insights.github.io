<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Budget 2001-02: Revive Investment</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In most countries, government budgets are of interest mainly to businesses</P>
<P>and businessmen. But ever since the 'development effort' began in earnest</P>
<P>in India in 1957, and with it steep increase in all kinds of taxes, the citizen has</P>
<P>taken a rather dim view of the budget. The only interlude was during</P>
<P>1991-97, when Dr Manmohan Singh began a process of cutting tax rates. But</P>
<P>ever since Mr Yashwant Sinha has taken over, the budget has</P>
<P>once again become something to dread. </P>

<P>This year is unlikely to be very different from the last two, which saw</P>
<P>consistent increases in taxes. </P>

<P>Indeed, tax increases are more likely this year as Mr. Sinha has to meet the norms set by the</P>
<P>proposed Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA). The Act imposes limits on the amount</P>
<P>of government borrowing. The process of reducing deficits may well </P>
<P>start with the forthcoming budget. By March 2006 the revenue deficit needs</P>
<P>to be eliminated wholly and the fiscal deficit needs to be brought down to</P>
<P>2 percent of GDP. The latter is now at about 5.5 per cent of GDP and two-thirds of it consists of the revenue deficit.</P>

<P>So, Mr Sinha's main problem is the revenue</P>
<P>deficit, namely, the gap between current revenue and expenditure. The latter</P>
<P>consists of interest payments, subsidies, defence and government</P>
<P>administration. Of these interest payments account for nearly half and are</P>
<P>committed payments on past borrowings. So they will not be easy to cut. </P>

<P>One way out might be to reduce the interest rate on small savings or the</P>
<P>Public Provident Fund, even though that might be politically unpopular --</P>
<P>all the more so with so many assembly elections falling due this year.</P>

<P>Last year, the interest rate on PPF was brought down by one percent. This reduced the government's interest burden to some extent. </P>
<P>Given the lack of an old age support system for</P>
<P>non-salaried employees, this rate is very sensitive. Yet, since there are</P>
<P>few vocal groups amongst them to pressurise the government, there may be a</P>
<P>move to reduce interest rates on small savings. </P>

<P>While arguing his case for the FRA the finance minister has said that fiscal deficits</P>
<P>are bad for inter-generational equity because they make future generations</P>
<P>pay for the excesses of this one. He is absolutely right. But he needs to</P>
<P>ask himself whether inter-generational equity is enhanced if existing</P>
<P>productive units like railways, power stations, roads, schools, hospitals</P>
<P>etc are run into the ground because political compulsions will not allow</P>
<P>the charging of economic prices. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cost of provision of services minus the amount collected through user</P>
<P>charges is the true measure of the excesses of the current generation and</P>
<P>it is the real burden which is being passed on to future generations.</P>
<P>It is consumers not paying even the average cost of</P>
<P>provision of services that constitutes a burden on future generations. What</P>
<P>sense does it make, for instance, that while power costs Rs 2.70 to</P>
<P>generate on average, the average price is only Rs 2.03? </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the Dabhol crisis unfolded, the possibility that the guarantees of the</P>
<P>state or central governments may be invoked has became quite real. In case</P>
<P>the MSEB had failed to pay Enron, the payment would have had to come from</P>
<P>the state, and failing that, the central government. Such means (by which</P>
<P>the government pledges future resources through guarantees) are not part of</P>
<P>the budget statement but should be. After all, they form an important part</P>
<P>of the 'excesses of the current generation'.</P>

<P>Indeed, the impending elections mean that Mr Sinha will find it hard</P>
<P>to raise user charges and reduce subsidies. (The railway minister,</P>
<P>Mamata Banerji has already indicated as much for railway fares).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thus the onus of containing the deficit may fall on taxes because of political pressures both for not cutting expenditure and not raising user charges. Taxes may rise </P>
<P>also because  Mr Sinha is under pressure from domestic industry to</P>
<P>do something in the matter of customs duties (even though this</P>
<P>could make him unpopular with traders who benefit from selling imported</P>
<P>goods). Though raising tariffs will fetch the government some much-needed revenue, it would be the wrong thing to do. It would provide  protection to domestic industry which is</P>
<P>demonstrably inefficient by world standards. </P>

<P>Where direct taxes are concerned, in all likelihood, his gaze will settle</P>
<P>on services whose share now accounts for close to half of India's GDP. Even if services are taxed at a rate of 1 percent, large revenues can be generated. But as taxing all services will not be feasible the question is which services he will tax, how much, and</P>
<P>in what way. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While other taxes may not be raised, and there may be some rationalisation of indirect taxes, where will the much needed boost to the economy come from? </P>
<P>In the immediate context what the budget needs to do is to revive</P>
<P>investment, which has been flagging for almost five years now. Despite</P>
<P>attempts by himself and his predecessor, the investment ratio has</P>
<P>been disappointing. The budget for 2001-02 will be judged mainly by its</P>
<P>success or failure in this regard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Last year witnessed a continuous decline in business sentiment (NCAER's Business Confidence Index has been falling since June 2000). This was attributed largely to the lack of good news on the economic front. An increase in investment requires an improvement in business sentiment. </P>
<P>Mr Sinha's main task is to achieve such a change of mood. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The various Chambers of Commerce have put forth scores of proposals to</P>
<P>revive investment. Some of these, such as a reduction in the surcharge on corporate income tax,  are designed to reduce the burden of tax or to increase the level of profit at the firm or</P>
<P>industry level. Instead of rejecting these proposals outright, because they may upset the budget's balance, Mr. Sinha may do well to consider those that will improve sentiment and could therefore increase investment. Higher investment will translate into higher GDP and  employment. Instead, he worries too much about housekeeping.</P>
<P> </P>

<P>In other words, Mr Sinha needs to be the bearer of good news. One way to do</P>
<P>so is to give the economy -- rather than the polity -- what it wants. That</P>
<P>is genuine reform and good macroeconomic management which, for once, puts economic populism on the back seat. And this is Mr Sinha's real problem: no one is confident that he will do</P>
<P>the needful. </P>

<P>Which, in fact, provides him with an opportunity. Even if he does very</P>
<P>little, it will go a long way. </P>
