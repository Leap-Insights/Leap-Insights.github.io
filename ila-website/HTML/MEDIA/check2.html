<p>Today there are millions of migrants in Western Europe. But as Karlsson points out, a large number of these are illegal. This means they do not pay income tax. Western European countries not only need these workers to work and prevent them from becoming very high wage economies, they need the taxes these workers can pay. Spain has recently legalised 800,000 illegal migrants, putting the issue on the front burner for other European nations. The next few years are likely to see significant changes in European attitudes.</p>
