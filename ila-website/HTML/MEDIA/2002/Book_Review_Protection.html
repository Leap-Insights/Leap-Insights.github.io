<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Book Title: Protection in Indian Manufacturing&nbsp; An Empirical Study</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Author: Hasheem Nouroz</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Publisher: Macmillan India Ltd</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Pages:230&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Price: 395/-</span></p>

</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Economic reforms in India have aimed at reducing the high levels of protection provided to the manufacturing sector. And, according to Nouroz's well researched study, they have succeeded. Both nominal and effective rates of protection have been brought down considerably. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">After briefly discussing the evolution of trade and tariff policy in since Independence, the author examines in detail the protection received by different groups of commodities classified as industry-based, trade-based, input-based, import competing, exporting, etc for both pre and post reform years. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">The concept of the nominal rate of protection includes not only the ad valorem tariff but also import restrictions, exchange controls, multiple exchange rates and any other measures that have the effect of raising the domestic relative price of a good above its relative price in the world market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt"> The study finds that though in the post reform period nominal tariff levels have not been lowered in a uniform manner, there has been an across the board reduction of tariffs by different amounts. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">The chapter on the effective rate of protection may be considered Nourouz's major contribution. The effective rate of protection measures the margin of protection on value-added in the production process rather than on the product price. The rate of protection is different from the nominal rate and depends on the stage of production at which duties are imposed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt"> The effective rate of protection is defined as the percentage excess of domestic value-added obtainable by the introduction of tariffs and its inputs over the world market value-added. While the nominal rate of protection affects consumers' choice, the effective rate of protection indicates the effects on the processing activity of tariffs on inputs and thus affects producers' choice. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">The author uses alternative measures to estimate the effective tariff rate. These are the simple average of tariff rates, import-weighted tariff rates and collection rates. Again she finds that protection has come down in the post reform period. However, when adjusted for the overvaluation of the exchange rate she finds that both nominal and effective rates of protection have increased.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt"> For instance, for exporting industries (that export more than 10 per cent of their output) she finds that the nominal rate of protection increased from 18 per cent in 1987-88 to 23 per cent in 1993-94, and the effective rate of protection increased from 22 per cent to 24 per cent over the same period. Even after the reforms import competing industries continue to be more protected than exporting industries. For import competing industries (those whose imports provide more than 10 per cent of domestic supply) the nominal rate of protection has increased from 31 to 37 per cent over this period and the effective rate from&nbsp; 41 to 47 per cent. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Tariff protection given to the manufacturing sector in India and its impact on productivity growth in the sector has been an important research theme. Isher Ahluwalia's results that there exists a negative correlation between total factor productivity growth and import substitution, have been challenged by the author. Using a different methodology to estimate capital stock and value added, Nourouz does not find a relationship between trade regimes and total factor productivity growth. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">The book leaves the reader with the impression that while India has gone some way in achieving the objectives of the trade reform, there is still a long way to go. The multiplicity of rates and lack of uniformity creates scope for lobbying. This affects both producer and consumer choice and continues to lead to inefficiencies in economy. A well researched and detailed study, the book is a must for students of India's trade policy and industrial development. </span></p>
