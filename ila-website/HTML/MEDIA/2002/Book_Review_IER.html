<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">At a time when the industrial sector in India is suffering from a severe slowdown, research in business cycles has generated considerable interest in the country. With the recent announcement of the NBER that the US economy is suffering from a recession, a special issue of the Indian Economic Review on Business cycles is very timely. This special issue is dedicated to Geoffery Moore who worked on business cycles at the NBER and Economic Cycle Research Centre at New York. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Business cycle research traditionally focused on the indicator approach to monitoring and forecasting business cycles. This involved the development of leading, coincident and lagging indicators for predicting business cycles. Recent research uses Markov switching model try to assess the probability of a change in regime that may be identified as a normal state or a recession.&nbsp; </span></p>

</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">The volume contains 16 papers, a number of which are in the economic indicator analysis tradition of Moore, especially by the authors from the Economic Cycle Research Centre while the others use the Markov approach. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Since research on business cycles is new in India, Banerjee, with co-author Layton, in one of the 4 papers on India,&nbsp; discusses the issue of which series should be used to examine the presence of cycles or turning points in India. He disagrees with the view that GDP, even if it were available monthly or IIP that measures monthly industrial production are a good measure. He argues that a broader measure must be used that includes employment, sales and income. He suggests that such a measure will capture more of the cycles experienced by the Indian economy than one that includes only a measure of output. Indeed, such a measure has been constructed by him and Dua in a previous paper following Moore's tradition of including more variables and not just relying on the GDP. In this volume they have a paper that discusses the construction of a leading indicator that leads that coincident indicator. The construction of the index is not data determined but follows Moore's method of including series that have proved useful elsewhere.&nbsp; According to the authors the monthly leading indicator index is based on indicators from different sectors of the economy like money supply and interest rates, construction and corporate sectors. (It would be useful to know the data, sources and behaviour of these series.)</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt"> As they expected in the Indian economy before liberalization, it was unable to lead the coincident indicator before the 1990s since the economy was not a market economy. In the 1990s the Indian economy is said to have experienced a recession beginning in May 1996 and ending in February 1997. (The leading indicator has not predicted another recession since that one. Thus technically the Indian economy is not yet in a recession and nor is one expected. )</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Chitre's work represents the first application of the NBER methodology to India. He analyses 94 monthly time series and prepares a list of indicators of recessions and revivals and tracks growth cycles in India over the period 1951-82. Chitre's correspondence with Moore on the subject is also reported in the paper. The fourth paper on business cycles in India by Gangadhar Darbha applies the regime switching model to Indian data. </span></p>

</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">In a paper on the usefulness of consumer and business confidence indexes in predicting turning points in the US and the UK, Batchelor shows that a fall in business confidence decreases the probability of staying in the high-growth state. Similarly, Ivanova and Lahiri evaluate the usefulness of the consumer sentiment index to predict aggregate consumption and its components. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12.000000pt">Practitioners and researchers working on business cycles will find the volume a useful reading. As the volume focuses on the technical aspects of predicting business cycles, those looking for the answers to what causes business cycles such as the recession period of 96-97 may be disappointed. </span></p>
