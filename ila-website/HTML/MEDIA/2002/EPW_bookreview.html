<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The benefit of hindsight
allows analysts to reconsider conventional wisdom and place events in
their proper perspective. The same is true of the East Asian currency
crisis. Apart from offering a commentary on the unfolding of events
in the upheaval, Mihir Rakshit, in this book brings together the
major theoretical and policy implications of the currency crisis. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The currency crisis in
East Asia caught even the keenest watchers of these economies
unawares. High GDP and export growth for nearly two decades and 
fiscal prudence had convinced most economists that there was no
impending crisis.  The Asian Development Bank, for instance, wrote in
the first half of 1997 , &ldquo;Most South East Asian economies are
expected to strengthen their performance in 1997 and 1998&rdquo;. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The main reason for the
failure of economists to predict the crisis was that existing
theories did not suggest that these economies were anything but
healthy. Even later, when the currency turbulence had begun, the
difficulty in reconciling the crisis with generally expected theories
was  responsible for the failure to understand the crisis. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Theories to explain
currency crisis in the post-Bretton Woods system were advanced in the
context of the first, Latin American currency crisis in the 1970s and
early 1980s and later the speculative attacks on some currencies
under the European Monetary System and the Mexican debacle of
1984-85. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The first generation of
currency crisis models explained a currency crisis under fixed
exchange rate regimes. They suggested that if the equilibrium
exchange rate, driven by fundamentals, consistently deviates from the
pegged rate, then the central bank will be unable to defend the
currency peg, no matter how big their foreign exchange reserves. It
was essentially expansionary domestic policies that led to the
deviation and the consequent pressure on the currency. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The focus of the first
generation models was on economic fundamentals that govern the long
run exchange rate and they were unable to explain the speculative
attacks on some European currencies such as the British pound in
1992-3. These crisis could not be attributed to long term
fundamentals. Second generation models try to explain these varieties
of currency crisis to the behaviour of the government and currency
traders. While the government maintains the peg as long as there is
no great speculative attack on the currency, it is not ready to
defend the currency at all costs. Thus if it is too costly to defend
the currency, the central bank does not do so and allows it to
depreciate. If there were no speculative attack then, unlike in the
first generation models, the currency peg could still have continued.
But if an attack takes place then it is the attack that raises the
cost of maintaining the currency. This makes it optimal for the
government to abandon the peg.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Given that these theories
were tailored to explain specific instances, the Asian crisis came as
a complete surprise to almost everybody as it did not fit in with
earlier experiences and theories. And, as the author suggests,
economists and analysts well versed in the then prevailing theories,
failed, not only to anticipate the problem, but also to foresee the
widening and deepening of the crisis, even after the fall of the Thai
Baht in mid-1977. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Krugman tried explain the
East Asian currency crisis  mainly on the grounds of a failure in
financial intermediation resting on the moral  hazard problem. The
problem arises because of the explicit or implicit guarantee of bank
deposits by governments. This leads banks to large scale extension of
credit for financing risky investments as these offer the &lsquo;Pangloss
return&rsquo;, that  which obtains under the best of all possible
circumstances. The resulting misallocation of resources is manifested
in a diversion of funds from projects having higher expected returns
to those yielding low or even negative returns on the average. The
moral hazard leads to an increase in domestic investment and saving.
The expected return on investment falls short of the cost of
borrowing so that a financial crisis becomes inevitable. Capital
account convertibility aggravates the crisis. Not only is there an
&lsquo;overinvestment&rsquo; but also a higher current account
deficit, a lower level of domestic saving, and a heavier burden of
domestic borrowing. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Rakshit suggests that,
one, since most investment in East Asian economies was not routed
through banks ( FDI and portfolio investment continued to be
substantial ) and two, since these countries enjoyed a prolonged
spell of high and sustained growth with little volatility, investment
in these countries could not have been driven by Pangloss returns. He
thus finds that neither the assumptions underlying Krugman&rsquo;s
hypothesis are in conformity with the conditions prevailing in the
East Asian financial markets, not are the predictions of the model
borne out by the East Asian experience. Further, he suggests that the
model suffers from a serious theoretical flaw which undermines the
relevance of its results. Investment in Krugman&rsquo;s framework
inevitably leads to widespread losses of firms and large scale
banking crisis and a rational economic agent should be able to
foresee this and thus not take the government&rsquo;s guarantee
seriously. Hence the behaviour of depositors in the Krugman model
cannot be explained in terms of rational expectations.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The bulk of the book
consists of 5 papers that were originally written over the period
1997-99 as a series of articles for Money and Finance. The
introduction discusses the evolution of the international financial
system theories explaining currency crisis. The  papers trace the
origins and explain the phases of the East Asian currency crisis. On
the basis of the behaviour of exchange rates, share prices and
interest rates he distinguishes between five phases of the Asian
currency crisis. He finds that financial variables went through two
major cycles in the course of the crisis. The behaviour of the real
side was, however, characterised by a single cycle with the GDP
declining everywhere from September 1997 and picking up only after at
least a year. Rakshit identifies the factors that differenciate the
Asian crisis from the Latin American and European ones and assesses
the role of liquidity, informational problems, fragility of short
term expectations and self-fulfilling expectations. He identifies the
combination of factors such as the downturn in export demand,
disproportionately large external liabilities in relation to foreign
exchange assets, and the weakening of banks balance sheets that may
force a country to renege on its foreign dues and suffer a currency
crisis.  He suggests comprehensive policy measures to make countries
less vulnerable to currency crisis and its impact.

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The book is made eminently
readable by its narrative style. Unlike books that offer theoretical
rigour by including equations and diagrams in the main text and at
the cost of readability, this one confines the rigorous theoretical
backup to appendices and footnotes for the more specialist reader.
The general reader can absorb the intuitive argument without losing
the main thread of the discussion with ease. This makes the book
valuable not only to academics and policy makers but also to those
who do not have an economics background but want to understand the
working of the international financial system, foreign exchange
markets and currency crisis.
