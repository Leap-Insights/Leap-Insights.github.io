<p><i>FSLRC recommendations would be challenged by the financial
regulators</i></p>
<p>Two of the most important committees on financial sector reform in
India in recent years-the Raghuram Rajan Committee and the Percy
Mistry Committee-have recommended a change in the regulatory
architecture. The problems of regulatory gaps, overlaps, turf wars,
and tension with the government have only increased since these
committees submitted their reports. While the Percy Mistry report
recommended a single unified regulator, Raghuram Rajan recommended a
more conservative approach-a banking and non-banking regulator,
keeping RBI as the banking regulator. The Financial Sector Legislative
Reforms Commission (FSLRC) has taken the more conservative approach of
two reports, keeping banking with RBI while proposing a merger of
other regulatory bodies into one regulator.</p>
<p>In almost every country where regulators have been unified as the
financial system has become more complex and as regulatory walls have
become hurdles to better regulation, existing regulators have fought
back. The past and present staff of various regulatory bodies are
amongst the biggest opponents of regulatory institutional change. No
doubt, in India too, turf war will take place. The commission, in
recommending a non-sectoral law, will no doubt make regulators and
many regulated entities, happy in the present set up, quite
unhappy. The debate on the draft law in public discourse will need to
go beyond who will administer the law and beyond the unhappiness of
regulators who find their turf encroached upon to the contents of the
law. In many ways, who administers the law is the least important part
of the recommendations of the commission.</p>
<p>Financial sector reform in India has been a slow process of
responding to the needs of a growing economy. Other than the
initiatives in the equity market, most changes in the framework of
financial regulation in India have been made in response to the need
of the hour. This has meant piecemeal changes to the various laws that
give powers to regulators to regulate finance. In addition to the many
amendments to the laws, there have been many committees looking into
the difficulties of finance. A slow consensus has grown which
recommends changes in the regulatory framework. However, many of these
changes were not possible since the basic structure of the law did not
allow it. The FSLRC was set up to review, rethink and redraft the
basic laws so that Indian finance can be reformed to prepare India as
a growing modern economy, without having to constantly amend existing
laws to incorporate changes in technology or other innovation.</p>
<p>This commission, which submitted its report to the finance minister
on March 22, 2013, was not a quick and dirty response to political
pressure in a crisis situation. It was a serious, consultative,
well-researched effort at rethinking the objectives of regulation, of
regulatory governance, and of the independence and accountability of
regulators in India. The job of the commission, which began two years
ago, was not to simply tweak and fix the things that were not working,
but to question the fundamental arrangements between regulators, the
government, the regulated and the consumer for whose protection
regulation is ultimately being done. The commission involved more than
a 100 people doing research, learning lessons from the global crisis
and consulting regulators, market participants and various
stakeholders.</p>
<p>What is the most important element of the new draft law-the Indian
Financial Code. This law puts consumer protection at the centre of all
regulation. Whether we have to reduce the risk of failure of banks or
an insurance company, so that depositors and policy holders are
protected, whether we have to find ways of rescuing failing entities
with minimum cost to the taxpayer, whether we have to find ways to
ensure that a household is not sold unsuitable products, or whether we
wish to prevent a disruption of financial services on the scale of the
system as a whole, the objective of the regulation is to protect the
consumer without putting the burden on the taxpayer.</p>
<p>The need for regulation arises because of the asymmetric power and
information that customers of financial services have, in contrast to
the providers, and they must be protected from unfair practices, or
from the provider taking very high risks to earn high returns. In this
framework, the objective of micro-prudential regulation,
i.e. regulation of entities in the financial sector, is to protect
customers. If regulation entails a higher burden on owners and
shareholders, in proportion to the risks they take and the commitments
they make, in order to protect customers, the burden may be
justified. After the global financial crisis, whose origins lay first
in the sale of unsuitable financial products to consumers, and then in
the lax regulation of financial firms that were holding those assets,
the commission has focused on the extremely important role that good
regulation can play in making the financial system resilient.</p>
<p>A major theme of many of the recommendations of previous committee
reports in India has been the opposite problem of those that led to
the global financial crisis. Instead of suffering from too much
innovation as the US is supposed to have witnessed in the run up to
the financial crisis, Indian regulators have often been found to do
excessive regulation and strangle of innovation. This issue can be
addressed by giving regulators clear objectives, through enumerated
powers. If the regulator simply wishes to ban something so that he
does not have to witness any risk on his clock, the law will not give
him the power to do so. He needs to demonstrate that the regulation is
required to meet the objectives assigned to him, and is within his
powers to do so, and that a cost benefit analysis of the regulation
shows that the additional cost, monetary or otherwise, of complying to
this regulation is going to bring clear benefits to the economy. The
regulator would be hopefully restricted by the proposed accountability
mechanisms not to prevent all innovation. Further, even if he does go
ahead and issues regulations that do not meet the objectives that are
given to him, the regulation can be challenged in a newly set up
Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal.</p>
<p>Once the draft code becomes law, regulators would be required to
write regulations in line with the powers and role given to them by
the new law. The process may take time, but the framework provided by
the FSLRC would lay the foundations of a well regulated modern
financial system in India.</p>
