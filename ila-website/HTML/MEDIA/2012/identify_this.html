<p><i>Financial justification for Aadhaar doesn't require it to cover
entire population or have multiple uses</i></p>

<p>Some people think of Aadhaar as a magic bullet for India. Others
oppose it for privacy concerns. The government has showcased Aadhaar
as a tool for targeted subsidy payments. As with all government
programmes, the public should be sceptical, and the government must
demonstrate through a cost-benefit analysis that the expenditure of
public money is justified. Aadhaar can only address the issue of
subsidies having ghost and multiple beneficiaries. In addition to the
money spent on Aadhaar, there are the complexities of
Aadhaar-integration for each subsidy scheme. The costs are
front-loaded, the benefits come much later. Is it worth building
Aadhaar? In a recent study at the National Institute of Public Finance
Policy (NIPFP), we undertook a cost-benefit analysis of Aadhaar from
this perspective. We find that the internal rate of return on building
Aadhaar is over 50 per cent. This suggests that we should proceed with
Aadhaar in order to run subsidy programmes better. The concerns about
privacy can be reduced by limiting Aadhaar to those individuals who
benefit from subsidies.</p>

<p>The main conclusion of the <a href="http://goo.gl/31gBQ">study</a> is that it
is worth undertaking the expenditure on Aadhaar, if only to plug
leakages arising from ghost and duplicate beneficiaries. The financial
justification for Aadhaar does not require it to cover the entire
population, and it does not require the scheme to have multiple
uses.</p>

<p>In developing countries, proposals to spend money on subsidy
programmes are generally seen positively. We think that having good
intentions in establishing a government programme or a government
agency is sufficient for good results. What is needed, instead, is
clarity of purpose for each government scheme, activity or
agency. Once the objectives are clear, we should be measuring
outcomes, and asking about the extent to which the stated objectives
were met. The moment outcomes are measured, it becomes possible to ask
bang-for-the-buck questions: Is there a way to achieve this goal at a
lower cost? Given two different ways to achieve a stated outcome,
which one is better?</p>

<p>The subsidy programmes run by the Indian state suffer from immense
problems that come from not asking such questions. Once we look beyond
the halo of moral purity, there is, typically, a lack of clarity on
objectives, failure to deliver on objectives, scanty knowledge of how
much money is being spent where and of who the beneficiaries are.</p>

<p>For example, the purpose of the public distribution system (PDS) is
to deliver cheap wheat and rice to the poor. It is easy to calculate
how much it would cost if, say, 100 kg of cereal per year were gifted
to 20 per cent of the poorest people in India. What we have instead is
a vast and sprawling enterprise that distorts the market for cereals,
which is characterised by theft at various levels, and has failed to
eliminate hunger among them.</p>

<p>Many people who think about public policy in India are fairly
convinced that a biometric identification system would help reduce
leakages in subsidy programmes. But while the expenses of having the
Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and enrolling
everyone are evident, there are also substantial integration costs
when programmes such as the PDS are UID-enabled. At the same time, the
scale of waste in existing subsidies is very large. The UIDAI is not a
magic bullet either; it will not solve the problem fully. It will only
solve two things: payments to non-existent persons, and payments to
one person multiple times.</p>

<p>The key impediment to a high quality cost-benefit analysis of UIDAI
is the lack of data and research about existing subsidy
programmes. The very problems of subsidy programmes, as presently run
by the Indian state, make a precise analysis of improvements in their
process engineering difficult. The NIPFP study overcame this
constraint by making a series of conservative assumptions.</p>

<p>When these estimates are put together into a formal cost-benefit
analysis, they demonstrate that the internal rate of return on
building UIDAI is around 50 per cent in real terms. We often find that
discussion on costs and benefits turns into a disagreement about
assumptions. To allow analysts to modify assumptions, a spreadsheet
with the full calculation, clearly showing all assumptions and
formulas, has been released on the Web. This makes it easy for anyone
to modify the assumptions and get new estimates if they disagree on
some of the assumptions.</p>

<p>The construction of the UIDAI, and the consequent transformation of
the existing subsidy programmes, is thus well justified. If the
government must run subsidy programmes, it should make sure there are
no leakages. These leakages are not just about wasted money: we also
have to worry about the political economy of business strategies that
are rooted in subverting state structures and stealing.</p>

<p>That leaves a distinct policy debate about the problems of
privacy. There is merit in civil liberty groups' concerns about the
threats to freedom in India, as well as in the concern about the
implications of better data in the hands of the government. A
reasonable compromise, which could satisfy everyone, consists of
emphasising the use of UIDAI for the beneficiaries of subsidy
programmes. For the people who wish to take money from the government,
we would intrude on their privacy to the extent of their having an
Aadhaar number and potentially suffering from the consequences of
greater tracking. It should be possible for a person who stands on his
own feet - who does not even buy subsidised LPG - to organise his own
life with zero tracking by government or security agencies. Such an
approach, where one is vigilant about information in the hands of
government, would strengthen the foundations of Indian democracy.</p>
