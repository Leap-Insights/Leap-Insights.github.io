<p>India is facing the prospect of stagflation. Output growth has
slowed down sharply, and is below the recent long-run average of
around 7% and consumer price inflation seems to be stuck at around
9-10% (see graphs).</p>

What should RBI's stance be in the forthcoming monetary policy
meeting? Under the current circumstances, perhaps the best
contribution RBI can make to India's long-term growth is not to give
in to the pressure for cutting interest rates, and steadfastly hang in
there till inflationary expectations come down. This may happen a few
quarters after consumer price inflation rates actually come down. If
it moves now, this may not happen.

<p>There is an increasing clamour for RBI to cut interest rates. The
government has announced a series of reform measures as well as steps
to cut the fiscal deficit such as cutting subsidies on diesel and
LPG. Additional plans for disinvestment have been announced. With
these and better tax administration, the government hopes to reduce
the fiscal deficit. RBI has been making the case that the government
needs to bring the fiscal deficit under control for inflation to come
down. With the present expansionary fiscal policy, RBI would need to
keep monetary policy tight to keep inflation under control. The
government is now suggesting that it is doing its bit to control the
deficit, so RBI must now ease monetary policy to kick-start investment
and push up growth.</p>

<p>RBI Governor Subbarao has a difficult call to make. Considering
 that inflation has remained high and above RBI's target rate of 4-5%
 for multiple years now, inflationary expectations have remained
 high. An easing of monetary policy at this stage will convey that a
 higher inflation rate is acceptable. This will keep inflation rates
 high as price setting, salary negotiations and contracts for the
 coming year will build in the higher inflation rate.

 The biggest problem with the investment rate today is issues of
government policy and implementation. Projects are stalled largely due
to environment and forest clearances, availability of ores and
minerals, which has become difficult due to mining bans or other
processes that are under litigation or investigation, the difficulties
of land acquisition, and the availability of power and water. The
government is now setting up a National Investment Board that is
expected to give clearances to all projects that cost R1,000 crore or
more. Only when projects that are currently stalled due to these
problems, bank loans that are being restructured due to these delays
and investor sentiment that has been dampened due to the inability of
investors to complete their projects on time, start moving ahead, will
the private sector have the appetite to take any further risks.
</p>


<p>While interest cost is obviously a component of any project, even
if interest cost were zero, until the risk of putting equity money
into projects can be justified by an expected positive return, many
investors are not going to invest more money. Since projects do not
run fully on loans, and the risks today posed by the governance
problems are so serious, cutting rates will do little to ramp up
investment</p>

<p>In most public debates, there is rarely a lobby for raising
interest rates. In general, industry lobbies who talk to media
persons, investment advisors and equity market analysts almost always
argue the case for rate cuts. They stand to gain from rate cuts and
the loud clamour created by them ignores the potential negative impact
of the policies they are arguing in favour of. In this case, interest
rates are the price being paid by some to others. So there are two
sides to the story. Those who lend, i.e the savers, are also impacted
by rate cuts. The household savings rate has dropped sharply in one
year from 25.4% of GDP in 2010-11 to 22.8% of GDP in 2011-12. Such a
sharp and sudden fall in household savings should be a matter of
concern. Where did this decline come from and why did it happen? What
would be the impact of an interest rate cut on household savings?

<p>This decline in household savings of 2.6% of GDP has come mainly
from a sudden and sharp decline in household financial savings. In
2010-11, household financial savings stood at 12.9% of GDP, while in
the following year they fell by 2.9% to 10% of GDP. Why did this
happen?</p>

<p>The year 2011-12 saw a decline in the growth of bank deposits and
small savings. Households prefer to save in real estate and
gold. Physical savings of households continued to be high, and even
rose slightly, from 12.4% of GDP in 2010-11 to 12.8% of GDP in
2011-12. The bulk of the increase in savings seem to have gone to
gold. Last year, gold imports rose dramatically. After the hike in the
tariff on gold in the budget, official imports of gold have
fallen. Stories from travellers suggest that customs officials in
Mumbai are actively trying to prevent gold smuggling in recent
months.</p>

<p>World commodity prices are expected to remain depressed as the
world economy remains sluggish. The rupee appreciation in recent
months has helped reduce the costs of tradables. The slowdown in
domestic demand will help stabilise domestic prices. When fiscal
policy measures actually have an effect and the deficit comes down,
the domestic pressure on prices will reduce. RBI should be in no hurry
to ease monetary policy as it can do more harm than good. </p>
