<p><i>Clarify policy and ease bottlenecks to spur investment</i>

<p>Preventing India's growth slowdown is a difficult but not
impossible task. The government needs to follow a two-pronged strategy
to put India back on a high-growth path. On the one hand, it must
focus on putting stalled projects back on track. On the other hand, it
must put in place policy frameworks for the allocation of land and
natural resources, as well as for environmental standards and the rule
of law.</p>

<p>Episodes like the 2G spectrum sale and the coal block allocation
issue demonstrate that the lack of a clear framework can seriously
disrupt investment and growth. Though there are no easy answers to
these questions, arriving at policy frameworks through research,
public consultation and discussions among stakeholders, and
implementing the rule of law, should make them more tractable than
they are today.</p>

<p>One somewhat simple way to address growth slowdown in the short run
may be through fiscal and monetary policies. But in India,
macroeconomic policy choices, even in the short run, are going to be
very difficult. The latest data on output and prices confirm the
stagflation that has been on its way. We now see growth slipping below
5 per cent, even as consumer price inflation reaches 9.75 per
cent. This is almost the reverse combination of what India witnessed a
few years ago at the peak of the business cycle.</p>

<p>As output growth slipped in September 2012, with the IIP data
showing an actual contraction in economic activity, consumer price
inflation continued to rise, hitting almost double digits. The trade
data released also showed a higher trade deficit. Stagflation is a
much more difficult problem than overheating, which happens when
prices and output are both rising, and which we saw in 2006 and
2007. That is when fiscal and monetary policy both need to be
contractionary. Tackling stagflation is also more difficult than
facing a recession, when fiscal and monetary policies both need to be
expansionary. When faced with stagflation, no standard recipes
work. Contractionary fiscal policy would mean raising tax rates,
something that would hurt investment further. Easing monetary policy
would mean cutting interest rates, something that would make inflation
worse. The experience of other countries like the US, which has seen
stagflation in the past, suggests that simple solutions can only
worsen economic conditions.</p>

<p>Standard macroeconomic stabilisation policies are not the answer to
India's economic problems today. One clear area of failure, which
needs government action, is governance issues. These are responsible
for having created an environment that has put on hold various
projects and discouraged further investment. The stalling of a large
number of investment projects since governance problems began,
especially after 2010, have reduced investment and worsened supply
constraints, particularly in infrastructure. Various bottlenecks,
especially bureaucratic and judicial, are now holding back the economy
as never before. The tools of macroeconomic policy are meant to
address an economy operating around its full capacity output. That
framework assumes that problems such as India's do not exist. India is
not at its long-run, steady-state growth rate. The output gap is not
caused by investment inventory cycles, which can be addressed by macro
policies.</p>

<p>To address immediate governance issues, the government has proposed
a National Investment Board (NIB) to speed up stalled projects. This
could help push up output as well as bring down prices. But the
environment minister, Jayanthi Natarajan, has opposed routing
environmental clearances through the NIB. This brings us to the
question of how the NIB will work. Can the bulk of issues on which
investment is stalled be resolved without transparent policy
frameworks in place?</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the reforms proposed by Finance Minister
P. Chidambaram created optimism among investors, both foreign and
domestic. But while it is true that the gloom and doom went away, it
was replaced only by a very cautious optimism. Investors need to see
the government take concrete steps before making investment
decisions. If large projects and large sums of money continue to be
stuck in governmental processes, and investment decisions keep getting
postponed, it will not encourage them to invest. Not only are
resources limited, an increasing number of bad assets reduces the
banks' ability to lend. It is not just that companies are constrained
by their capacity to incur further risk, there is a trust and
governance deficit. Equally important are the worsening finances of
the banking sector. The government needs to act quickly.</p>

<p>But if the laws that create a policy framework are not in place,
there are fears that the very clearances that such a board gives could
be challenged in court the very next day. Therefore, the second
element of the strategy is to understand why projects were stalled and
to correct the existing policy frameworks. </p>

<p>There will be no simple answers. In the process of economic growth,
there are trade-offs between protecting the environment, forests and
land rights on the one hand, and creating infrastructure, generating
power, making dams, encouraging mining and other economic activity on
the other. Any solution that swings to one extreme will not work. It
will be very easy to stall projects if citizens who are losers in the
process, or those that support them, go to court or use political
pressure to stop economic activity. Any attempt to push through
projects in a non-transparent or arbitrary way will not be acceptable
either. There is no doubt that India will have to industrialise, but
in such a way that the environment and forests are protected. It is
essential to put in place the rule of law and processes to ensure that
such issues do not hijack politics and economics.</p>

<p>Most countries face similar problems when they grow fast. As the
Indian economy has grown, the stakes involved have become very
high. With that, corruption in high places has become more
attractive. What must be a priority is the creation of policy
frameworks, for example, strategies for the sale of natural resources
or public sector enterprises, through auction or otherwise, should be
formulated in a transparent, consultative process, with independent
research and discussions with stakeholders, where the public
understands the debate and buys into the solutions.</p>
