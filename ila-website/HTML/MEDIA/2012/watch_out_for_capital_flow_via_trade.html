<p>In the recent discussion on capital flight from China, the
country's State Administration of Foreign Exchange denied the
speculation that there was capital outflow. While capital flight
through official channels can be observed directly on the capital
account of the balance of payments, when capital flows on the capital
account are restricted, flight may take place through the current
account. Since the trade account for China is large, it provides a
channel for capital movements. The discussion on whether there is
capital flight from China cannot be settled without an analysis of its
trade account.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, when the literature identified capital
flight through trade misinvoicing, countries had significant
restrictions on trade. Even then, misinvocing offered a serious
channel for capital flows. It was found that in countries that have
capital account restrictions, greater trade integration creates
greater opportunities to shift capital through trade misinvoicing.

Trade misinvoicing only captures flows through merchandise
trade. Services, and the difficulties of assessing the price of, say,
a client-specific software, by a customs officer, offer further
channels for misinvoicing, and are not accounted for in the trade
data. Even beyond this, not all movement of capital through mispriced
trade results in a difference between export and import values. For
example, a form of trade mispricing that facilitates movement of
capital or profits across borders is transfer pricing by multinational
corporations. Such mispricing does not result in any discrepancy
between the import and the export values. Trade misinvoicing thus
underestimates the extent of capital flows that can take place through
the current account. The accompanying table shows that flows on
account of misinvoicing are as significant as net capital flows to a
country.</p>
<p>In a recent paper, my co-authors and I found out that capital
controls in countries with large trade flows are correlated with high
levels of trade misinvoicing. After controlling for factors such as
macroeconomic stability, corruption, currency overvaluation, and
political instability, the openness of the capital account still has a
significant role to play in determining trade misinvoicing. Trade
misinvoincing should be viewed as a channel for de facto capital
account openness. During 1980 to 2005, the average extent of
misinvoicing induced capital flows in developing countries was of the
amounted to around 38% of official flows, and 7.6% of GDP.</p>
<p>The magnitude of trade misinvoicing is conventionally estimated by
juxtaposing trade data from the importing and the exporting country. A
firm interested in moving capital out of a country would underinvoice
its exports, thus bringing reduced foreign exchange into the
country. Similarly, overinvoicing of imports would allow the domestic
importer to gain access to greater foreign exchange than
required. Both these mechanisms leave domestic firms in control of
hard currency assets overseas. Underinvoicing of imports, on the other
hand, can result from an attempt to evade taxes on imports including
customs duties and the value-added tax (VAT) on imports.</p>
<p>The overall misinvoicing of imports that is computed using
macroeconomic data reflects a certain cancelling out between certain
firms who are engaged in underinvoicing of imports and other firms who
are engaged in overinvoicing of imports. Similar considerations apply
with misinvoicing of exports. To the extent that firms have
heterogeneous goals, the measured misinvoicing is likely to understate
the true scale of gross capital flows being achieved through
misinvoicing in an economy.</p>
<p>The traditional literature focussed on two broad motivations for
misinvoicing. First, it emphasised high customs duties. When firms pay
high rates of customs duties or VAT on imports, they have an incentive
to understate the true value of imports. Second, misinvoicing was
viewed as a method for achieving capital flight, which was, in turn,
motivated by fears of expropriation in interplay between unsound
economic policy and political instability.</p>
<p>A critical factor influencing trade misinvoicing that has been
identified in the literature is the extent of exchange rate
overvaluation. An overvalued exchange rate as well as high inflation
rate raise expectations of depreciation in the near future and
stimulate capital flight. Research on the determinants of the large
outflows of capital from Latin American countries in 1980s and Asian
economies in late 1990s has identified explanatory variables such as
macroeconomic instability, large budget deficits, low growth rates and
the spread between foreign and domestic interest rates. These factors,
as well as others such as corruption, political freedom, and
accountability were significant in explaining capital flight from
sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p>We find that the extent of misinvoicing is seen to be higher among
developing countries than industrialised countries over the period
1980-2005. Also, misinvoicing has declined steadily in industrialised
countries, while with developing countries, this trend remains
mixed. By the logic of this traditional literature, when countries
like India and China achieved high GDP growth and cut customs duties,
the motivation for misinvoicing should have subsided. In this paper,
we find that by and large, such a decline in misinvoicing is not
visible.</p>
<p>The evidence on misinvoicing suggest that studies on the
effectiveness of capital controls should also take into account
unofficial flows through the trade account as these may be further
eroding the effectiveness of capital controls.</p>
