<i>Investment is unlikely to take off as highly leveraged firms and stressed banks can't take on more risk</i>
</p><p>Recent initiatives by the government-the postponement of GAAR,
FDI in multi-brand retail, and the proposal to set up a Cabinet
Committee on Investment (CCI), earlier called the National Investment
Board, have not started showing up in pushing growth up as yet. This
is not surprising because deeper problems remain. Power projects still
face problems in obtaining coal as raw material and collecting money
for power distributed and sold to states. Highly leveraged companies
and banks with stretched balance sheets are in no position to take
further risk. Investment is likely to remain low till policy changes
to solve deeper problems and companies and banks have time to clean up
their balance sheets. The cautious optimism that came with policy
reforms has not yet started giving signals of a growth upswing.</p> 
<p>Recent data on output, exports and credit do not show an
improvement. Under these circumstances, GDP growth in 2013-14 could
well hover around 5-5.5%. The government seems to be banking on fast
track clearances to stalled projects. This is unlikely to be have a
large effect in the short run. Few companies are in a position to
start investing in new projects today. Few banks are in a position to
lend to them. Perhaps these are among the reasons why data is not
showing a pick-up so far.</p> 

<p>Let us look at the most recent data. Monthly and quarterly data
needs to be seasonally adjusted before it can be used. Otherwise,
seasonality in the data can make month-on-month comparisons
meaningless. But once this is done, it offers more insights into the
most recent trends in the economy than the yearly growth rates
do. Instead of being an average of the last 12 months, the data can
reflect the month-on-month moving average. This indicates what
year-on-year data would do with a lead of about 5 months. We look at a
few leading and coincident indicators of the economy using
seasonally-adjusted data below. This data is available at
<a target="blank" href=" http://www.mayin.org/cycle.in/tracking.html"><i>here</i></a>, from where it can be downloaded. In most cases, the data shows the 3-month moving average of the month-on-month seasonally-adjusted variable.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the seasonally-adjusted growth rate of GDP. This
number has now settled just about 5% and is not showing up and down
swings of the kind that were happening till 2010.</p>
<p>Similarly, figure 2 shows the 3-month moving average of the
seasonally-adjusted IIP growth. Again, once growth declined after
2010, it has not swung back. The monthly volatility has dampened and
growth is fluctuating around zero.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the growth in non-food credit. This is measured in
nominal terms, unlike production data indices, which are measured in
real terms. Again the month-on-month seasonally-adjusted rate has
slowed down, and on average the growth has been roughly 15%, which is
just a little higher than the inflation rate. Credit growth has thus
slowed down to the growth rate of roughly to about 5%. Credit growth
usually rises before an upswing in production. The slow growth shows
that the credit has not started expanding yet.</p>
<p><img style="float: right"  src="./IMAGES/fe_28-12-2012_1.png" width="350px" hspace="10px" vspace="10px"/>Figure 4 shows the increase in the rupee value of non-oil exports
growth. We focus on non-oil exports since oil exports have more to do
with the domestic fuel pricing policy induced refining in India,
rather than an indication of business cycle conditions. Again, the
month-on-month growth data is dismal. While export growth depends on
the conditions in the rest of the world, it is sometimes a leading
indicator for output in the Indian economy. When exports start rising,
other production rises in response.</p>
<p>Figure 5 shows the growth in the rupee value of non-oil
imports. This is often a coincident indicator as higher production
requires higher import of raw materials, and India is a large importer
of raw materials. More investment requires more imports of
machinery. But, as we see, import growth shows no upswing.</p>
<p>To summarise, the variables that are in general seen to show an
upswing when the economy shows an upswing, are not showing improvement
so far. This does not bode well for the economy. Other evidence, which
shows that investment growth has slowed down this year, from more than
12% to around 5%, has been a cause for concern. Returns from projects
in which companies have invested appear to be low, or are zero, as
companies grapple with missing infrastructure, stopping of raw
material supplies due to delay in environmental clearances and
concerns over forest peoples rights. These companies are highly
leveraged, have capital trapped in large projects that have been
stalled due to government incompetence or corruption issues. In many
cases, these companies have had to go in for debt restructuring of
their bank loans. These companies are not particularly in a mood to
invest. Even if interest rates are lowered, there is likely to be
nothing more than a marginal increase in investment, if at all.</p>
<p>Will the CCI, that will push to getting stalled projects started
again, be able to bring back high GDP growth. First, there are
questions about the power and the legal framework in which the CCI
will function. The committee might not have had the required powers to
work had it been under the ministry of finance. Other ministries had
objected to it giving clearances to projects that the relevant
ministries had not given. It has, therefore, been brought under the
Cabinet, which can play the role of coordination and apply time lines
for all clearances. But it still remains to be seen how well this will
work and whether projects once cleared do not get embroiled into
controversy and get stuck again in court battles.</p>
<p>Further, will the committee be able to push all stalled projects?
First, a large number of projects may have been stalled as they seem
profitable under favourable conditions when the world was looking
good, the economy was in a boom and credit was growing at over 30%
with real interest rates zero or negative. Even if clearances are
given, these projects may not be attractive today. Second, while a
large number of projects may have originally got stuck due to, say, a
land acquisition problem, but during the delay, the balance sheet of
the company weakened as it was unable to get the returns it expected
and make the payments it needed to, including interest payments to
banks. Infrastructure companies, for example, would be far more
cautious today about investing money in a stalled project. The
bureaucracy, regardless of whether it is in the ministry of finance,
or in the environment and forest ministry, will be far more cautious
in giving clearances today than last year. It seems that it will be
some time before a see a pick up in investment and economic
activity.</p>
