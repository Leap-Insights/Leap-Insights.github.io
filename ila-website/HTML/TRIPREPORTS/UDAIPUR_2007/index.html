<h1>Transparency and local public goods: A
field visit to Udaipur and Rajsamand districts, Rajasthan<br>
<a href="http://openlib.org/home/ila">Ila Patnaik</a>, 19 February 2007
</h1>

<HR>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>We look at questions about public administration, public goods and
decentralisation, in the districts of Udaipur and Rajsamand in
Rajasthan.</p>

<p>Why Rajasthan? Rajasthan is an interesting state for understanding
the linkages between panchayati raj, transparency and public goods
outcomes under conditions of poor per capita GDP. <b>First,</b>
Rajasthan is one of the original `BIMARU' states. It has had a high
poverty rate, a long history of drought, and of governments running
public works programs as a mechanism for targeted transfers to poor
people when faced with a drought. There is a long history of popular
dissatisfaction with corruption in these public works
programs. <b>Further</b>, Rajasthan is also unique in that it was the
first state in India to embark on panchayati raj. Their act dates back
to 1959. This has perhaps helped superior institutional
development. <b>Finally</b>, Rajasthan was the centre of activism by
groups such as MKSS on the right to information. It is, hence, an
ideal test bed in trying to understand the role of transparency and
panchayati raj in inducing public goods outcomes under conditions of
poor economic development.</p>

<p>Why these districts? MKSS is located in the village of Devdungri,
which is near Bhim at the north edge of Rajsamand
district. Information from Udaipur and the southern edge of Rajsamand
districts was interesting from the viewpoint of seeing the impact of
the <i>ideas</i> of MKSS and their institutional impact, but not the
hands-on high-quality activism. The former is scalable while the
latter is not. We would like to understand the impact of institutions
and ideas, but not idealistic and highly motivated activists.</p>

<p>While this perspective was our main focus, we were also
opportunistic in using our presence there to sniff into all manner of
aspects of public administration and public goods outcomes.</p>

<p>Udaipur district is <a
href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=udaipur+district&num=20&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&as_allsubj=some&as_subj=bus&hl=en&lr=&safe=off">a
popular venue</a> for writing papers. But is it a typical district in India?</p>

<p>We should perhaps take everything about Udaipur district and its
immediate environs with a small pinch of salt. These are surely benign
conditions by Indian standards. But still, if in such a setting, it's
possible to obtain good public goods in villages where the poverty
rate exceeds 30%, that's progress.</p>

<h2>MKSS</h2>

<p>Public works as a tool for drought relief have been taking place in
Rajasthan for a long time. As an example, Umeed Bhavan at Jodhpur -
the last huge palace built in the world - was a response to an extreme
drought. In independent India, public works programs continued
to be initiated by the government when faced with droughts. The
problems of corruption in public works achieved political salience in
Rajasthan many decades ago. When thinking about the depth of poverty
in a drought, it was natural to ask where the payments made by the
state government were going, and why they were not reaching the
intended recipients.</p>

<p>MKSS is a `non party political organisation' which has played an
important role in the evolution of these questions in Rajasthan. They
focused on problems of transparency in public works. MKSS is located
in the village of Devdungri, which is near Bhim at the north edge of
Rajsamand district. MKSS has a staff strength of 14 and their direct
impact is limited to their immediate neighbourhood, which is the north
edge of Rajsamand district.</p>

<p>Working from the ground up, MKSS could observe what an individual
worker got paid. In order to cross-check this against the payments
made upstream, they needed access to records in the government. In
this, they came up against the Official Secrets Act.</p>

<p>This led to a focus on transparency and the `right to
information'. MKSS pioneered this effort, first achieving some limited
<i>de facto</i> access to records at the panchayat level at an
informal level through friendships with the bureaucracy; then
successfully campaigning for panchayat-level right to information in
Rajasthan; which went on to become a broader level effort on right to
information in Rajasthan and then at the national government.</p>

<p>A process called `social audit' has been emphasised. Their term
`social audit' connotes a comprehensive review of the expenditures and
actual asset creation from public works programs. The effort is to
track every payment made by the government, and verify that it was
made correctly.</p>

<p>The primary focus of this `transparency movement' in Rajasthan is
on public works. The `social audit' is almost exclusively focused on
the issue of workers getting paid correctly in public works. In the
last one year, it appears that Rs.100 crore has been spent under NREG
in Dungarpur district (south of Udaipur) with remarkable single-digit
leakage in percent, as verified by very detailed audits done by
MKSS.</p>

<h2>Experiences</h2>

<p>On our visit, we met elected representatives, government officials
and activists in Udaipur and Rajsamand. No prior notice was given to
the participants or officials.  The information sources include:</p>

<ol>
<li> Meetings with the collectors of Udaipur and Rajsamand districts;
<li> Observing an inspection of a village in Rajsamand district by the
  CEO of the Zilla Parishad of Rajsamand;
<li> Observing a day of a `social audit' of NREG in GP Dhar in
  Udaipur district;
<li> Meetings with activists from MKSS and Aastha.
<li> Visit to a new PPP health facility in Udaipur; visit to an ANM
  in the village Piparda (Rajsamand district) along with the Chief
  Medical Officer of Rajsamand;
<li> Meetings with officials of the ULBs of the cities of Rajsamand
  and Udaipur.
</ol>

<h3>Capacity building by MKSS and Aastha</h3>

<p>Aastha is another remarkable NGO working in Rajasthan. At the time
when we were there, Aastha and MKSS were jointly running a capacity
building program at the `Aastha Training Centre' in Bedla, which is on
the outskirts of Udaipur. Eleven teams of Aastha and MKSS staff,
coupled with volunteers from the region and from all over the country,
were fanning out to locations all over Udaipur district, conducting
`social audits' of NREG and building awareness amongst citizens about
their rights in the environment of NREG, RTI and panchayati raj. Each
team spent roughly three days at one village.</p>

<p>On the terrace of the Aastha Training Centre was an assembly of the
volunteers listening to talks on how NREG works, what are the pitfalls
where corruption comes about, and how to do a social audit. One of the
speakers was a state level civil servant. Perhaps half the audience
was attentive and enthusiastic. There were a variety of dignitaries
and visitors passing through. One set of visitors were from the
Northwest Frontier Province in Pakistan.</p>

<h3>`Social audit' cum NREG awareness in Dhar</h3>

<p>We then hooked up with one of the eleven teams, at a village (a GP)
called Dhar which is roughly a one-hour drive away from Udaipur, in
Block Badgaon. It has one huge advantage: that of being connected by
road to Udaipur. Many of the menfolk commute to Udaipur to work every
day. Despite this, Dhar is poor. There are roughly 1000 families (a
population of 4,500), of which roughly 350 are classified as BPL -
implying a poverty rate of roughly 35%.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How poor is Dhar? We understood the high labour intensity of
    work when we saw a man and wife and two cows engaged in a
    phenomenally inefficient process of crushing sugarcane. They would
    then go on to produce jaggery which would be sold in the
    city.</td> <td> <a href="P1010475.JPG"><img

    stalk at a time) into the crusher; the children ran in for the

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><i>Labour intensity of crushing sugarcane in Dhar</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>One thing that caught us by surprise was that even though Dhar has
a population of 4,500, it is <i>highly</i> dispersed. Clumps of homes
are dispersed over many kilometres; and this is a hilly region so it
is costly to build roads or pipes that span these distances. This
makes it much harder to produce public goods. A concentrated town of
4,500 is typical in the West, and efficiencies of public goods
production can be obtained. But when dwelling places are dispersed in
this fashion, it becomes much harder. </p>

    information from workers in NREG and cross-checking these against
    records in the panchayat, over a two day period. On the third day,
    there is a Gram Sabha meeting, where the Aastha/MKSS people show
    up with evidence about malfeasance (if any) that they are able to
    find. It is enough to make any civil servant quail.</td>

    photograph. Often the photograph would be of one person in the
    household only. Sometimes the job card spanned three
    generations. The social audit team raised objections about this
    because the NREG act says the every household with dependents
    should get a separate job card and the card should carry
    photographs of every member of the household. The household on the
    left edge of the picture has a thumbprint while the household on
    the right has a signature. In Bihar, the recordkeeping did not
    remotely achieve even this quality.</td> <td> <a

<p>The Aastha/MKSS team did well in the fine line between insistence
and anger. They put pressure on the civil servant, saying that he is
earning a salary and ought to be doing certain kinds of work. But at
the same time, this did not cross the line into aggression and
confrontational politics. This balance reflected a remarkable maturity
of the team.</p>

<p>A simple piece of arithmetic which was repeatedly trotted out was
the number obtained by multiplying the number of job cards, times 100
days a year, times Rs.73/day. This was the money that could have come
from the government into this village - if only the populace and the
civil servants handled their end of the bargain properly.</p>

<p>The task of social audit is tedious, hard work. It involves
comparing information derived from citizens against information found
in the records of the gram panchayat. This should ideally be done by
an IT system, based on computer records at the GP level. As awareness
of this vulnerability to cross-checking is permeating in Rajasthan,
the mechanism of malfeasance is changing, to a method where both the
records at the GP and the job cards show wrong information.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Two kinds of malfeasance are now taking place. First, the
    state government staff collaborates with some NREG workers who
    actually do no work. The work done by the entire set of workers is
    divided by a bloated denominator, thus showing that everyone did
    inadequate work in the day, thus inducing a lower payment per
    person. The second line of attack is where the worker is told by
    the civil servant that he is being paid less and is told to not
    complain about it. In both cases, the information in the job cards
    agrees with the information in the GP.</td>

<p>The Aastha/MKSS people are averse to migration, arguing that
atleast for 100 days, a person shouldn't have to go to the city if
(net of transportation costs) his wage works out to below that paid by
NREG (Rs.73 if a full day's work is done). However, in the big
picture, India's economic development is going to come out of a low
skill workforce leaving the villages and migrating to the cities. More
importantly, a person seeking to do labour supply in the city has to
build up human networks and specialised human capital. Dropping out of
this market for 100 days/year is not a rational strategy for the
worker - regardless of how well NREG works.</p>

<p>In Dhar, the Aastha/MKSS team emphasised that NREG was a <i>demand
driven</i> program, that the GP has to maintain a project shelf and
offer projects when the individual demands work. This was in sharp
contrast with the situation in Bihar, where there were targets given
to the district collector and a budgetary grant of a certain amount
came down to the village.</p>

<h3>Village Molela in Rajsamand district</h3>

<p>We spent a day visiting Molela, a village in Rajsamand
district. This was an unannounced visit, accompanying the `CEO of the
Zilla Parishad', Mr. Jitendra Upadhyay, who was going for an
inspection here. Mr. Upadhyay's team had gone to Molela for an
inspection earlier in the day (before we had showed up). He was to go
to Molela to check their work and complete this inspection. We were
spontaneously offered an opportunity to go with him.</p>

<p>As we found out later, even though Molela is in Rajsamand district,
nobody from MKSS has ever been there. This is admittedly a sample size
of one; but it is not a case of being shown a Potemkin village.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>This concept of an `inspection' of a gram panchayat is a
    recent innovation, initiated by Principal Secretary (RD) in
    Rajasthan. Each district has a `CEO' of the Zilla Parishad and in
    many districts, the CEO has an assistant. In addition, there are
    Block Development Officers at the block level. The inspection
    framework involves filling out a two-page form about the processes
    in the panchayat. Each CEO is required to inspect 20 panchayats
    per year and if he has an assistant then the assistant is to
    inspect another 30 panchayats a year.</td>
    <td>
      <a href="P1010425.JPG"><img src="./thumbnails/tn_P1010425.JPG"

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><i>Jitendra Upadhyay, CEO of the ZP of Rajsamand</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The quality of the inspection is, obviously, sensitive to the
personality and style of the person conducting the
inspection. Mr. Upadhyay did an outstanding job, taking the trouble of
going to far-flung locations in the village in order to do physical
inspection of public works. At every step of the inspection, he was
very open with us, passing on the documents to us after he had
finished looking at them.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sudhir is a young, educated, enthusiastic sarpanch. In Bihar,
    there is a separation between the `mukhiya' and the `sarpanch'. In
    Rajasthan, there is only a `sarpanch'.</td>
    <td>
      <a href="P1010436.JPG"><img src="./thumbnails/tn_P1010436.JPG"

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><i>Sarpanch of Molela</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The problem of political accountability surfaces here also, as it
does in Bihar. By the rules of reservation, Sudhir will not be able to
run for sarpanch in the next election. Mr. Upadhyay explained that
Sudhir has ambitions of district-level politics, which is what gives
him incentives to do a good job of his stint as sarpanch.</p>

<p>The inspection process was pretty comprehensive. Helped by the
form, Mr. Upadhyay and his staff ran through a comprehensive checklist
of the activities of the village. The sarpanch and the sachiv were on
their toes showing records. "Have you done X?" and "Are your records
on X sound?" were the two lines of questioning.</p>

<p>The quality of the activities of the GP, and the corresponding
recordkeeping, was simply extraordinary. We sniffed into the past and
found good records for earlier years also. A delicious feature was the
use of photographs: for all public works, there was a photograph of
the ground prior to construction, a few photographs of the
construction in progress, and then a picture of the finished
product.</p>

<p>As in Bihar, we asked Sudhir our standard question: "What are your
key responsibilities?". For the first time, the answer that came back
put education at rank 1.</p>

<p>In Molela, for the first time, we felt that it might make sense to
send the three Fs down to such a gram panchayat. The sarpanch, the
civil servant attached to him, the recordkeeping, the transparency:
these have combined to create an environment of accountability and
public administration where it now makes sense to send more untied
money to the GP.</p>

<p>There is no direct link between MKSS and Molela. However, it is not
difficult to trace the indirect relationships between the RTI effort
in Rajasthan as a whole with the facts on the ground at Molela. The
RTI agenda has pushed the quality of recordkeeping. It has increased
the sense amongst the civil service and the politicians that they will
be asked questions. Most importantly, it has generated myriad changes
in the mechanisms of public administration - e.g. the use of
photographs, the idea of inspections. These changes in the thinking
and processes amongst civil servants and politicians constitute a
sustained impact - they do not rely on a continued engagement with
NGOs. These changes extend far beyond the direct impact of MKSS -
e.g. nobody from MKSS has ever visited Molela.</p>

<h3>One anecdote in health</h3>

<p>We went to an inspection of one PHC. The ANM was educated to the
10th standard and had a permanent job. On one hand, the health
outcomes sounded very good. In the last one year, there were 133
births and one child died. This is well below the Indian IMR. In the
last 19 years, no mother had died in childbirth, which is also well
below the Indian MMR.</p>

<p>Yet, the ANM reported that in a village of 5,000 people, she had
just 6-7 people walk in every day. This is a tiny number; you'd have
to have a miraculously healthy population to achieve this.</p>

<p>It turns out that there is a two-part explanation of why citizens
are not opting for public health services but attaining good health
outcomes.</p>

<p>First, there is absolutely no incentive for the ANM to do any work
for the citizen. In the entire district, there are roughly 40
complaints a year against the ANM, and out of them, two result in an
ANM getting transferred. No ANM ever gets sacked. Citizens are also
unlikely to complain about the ANM functioning when they know that it
is unlikely that action will be taken against the ANM.</p>

<p>Second, this village appears to be harnessing good income growth,
owing to physical proximity to the thriving marble trade. In the
immediate neighbourhood of the village, there are many jobs in
processing marble. Hence, the story appears to be one of people
achieving higher incomes and then defecting away from public
services. People do not come to the ANM and go to the local quacks(who
are no less qualified than her) or the the city which is well
connected with this area through roads.</p>

<p>Once again, it feels that the most powerful tool in health policy
is building roads.</p>

<p>While at this village, we discovered that the National Rural Health
Mission (NRHM) has built in a big cash subsidy aimed at bringing
customers back to government hospitals. If a pregnant woman chooses to
go to a private hospital, the full cost has to be borne by her. But if
she comes to a government hospital, (a) the treatment is free and (b)
she is given a gift of Rs.1,800. It will be interesting to see what
this does to the market share of government hospitals, and to the
MMR. This `negative voucher' situation is similar to the situation in
education, where government schools are free, give out free meals and
throw in some other perks, while private schools are unfree and offer
no perks.</p>

<h2>Inferences</h2>

<h3>Transparency</h3>

<p>Our main finding is that the quality of recordkeeping at the PRI
level was outstanding, particularly when compared with Bihar. Further,
information and official records in both districts were freely
available. No one brought up official secrecy or asked why information
was being sought. Detailed information and records were willingly
shown, without hesitation, in both districts.</p>

<p>Record keeping in both Udaipur and Rajsamand district was equally
good. The efforts of MKSS appear to have led to improvements in the
systems, institutions and the quality of record keeping. What started
as a bottom-up movement by people demanding their due from the
government appears to have turned today into a top-down strategy where
government officials are now bound by the amended Rajasthan PRI Act,
which ensures availability of information, and the Right to
Information Act. The media and general awareness of PRIs about their
rights has created an environment in which this works.</p>

<h3>Issues of scalability</h3>

<p>MKSS has a staff strength of 14 and has been active only in a
limited areas. It was therefore interesting to ask whether the effort
of achieving transparency is scalable and can be achieved without the
presence of a strong core of activists. As stated above, our finding
was that even in areas where there was no MKSS presence, there was a
remarkable culture of transparency. This had come about because of
greater awareness of the public about their rights through the media,
as well as the systems that have been put in place by the state
government that ensure that all panchayat level records are accessible
to the people. District and block level officers have an incentive to
maintain good records so that if and when a demand for information
comes up, there is no trouble.</p>

<p>As a consequence, even in places where direct activism is absent, the
institutional and legal changes that have been made are inducing a
much higher level of transparency than was prevalent earlier. It thus
appears that this effort can be scaled up even without having an MKSS
in every village in the state or country.</p>

<h3>Public goods and transparency</h3>

<p>Social audits and cross-checking payments is clearly very important
in public works programs for building roads. Given a minimal level of
care in rules and procedures, it is easy to ensure that public works
do not constitute private goods. Transparency in the choice of what
public works are built, and in the implementation, has given improved
planning and execution. It is easy to see strong links from
transparency to improved public works to improved GDP growth. If we
think of the principal-agent problem of public works under NREG in
Udaipur district, using the five-step naming scheme of WDR 2004:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Delegation</dt><dd>PR level civil servants appear to be clear on their
  job - that of maintaining a project shelf of public works programs,
  of identifying programs that require labour and little materials.</dd>
<dt>Financing</dt><dd>Adequate financing (as per the rules of the NREG
  game) appears to be flowing down into the hands of these civil
  servants.</dd>
<dt>Performance</dt><dd>Projects identified in the gram sabha are taken up
  and they do appear to get executed.</dd>
<dt>Information</dt><dd>The emphasis on transparency is improving
  information flows in the sense of helping to identify corruption
  through which payments to workers are embezzled.</dd>
<dt>Enforcement</dt><dd>There appears to be enough pressure in the
  political system for local civil servants and <i>sarpanch</i>es to
  fear the consequences of getting caught with corruption.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In a narrow class of problems -- the NREG style implementation of
public works programs with 90% of the money spent on labour -- the
accountability mechanisms in Udaipur and Rajsamand appear to be
functioning well. Part of this story lies in the success of the
transparency movement. But equally, part of this story is about a
substantial political focus upon a very narrow class of problems:
public works programs funded by the centre involving no external
contractor and where only 10% of the expense is on materials.</p>

<p>If even a slightly more complex problem appeared -- e.g. recruiting
a private vendor to build a road where 60% of the money was to be
spent on materials -- the existing systems and procedures in Rajasthan
might well be quite inadequate.</p>

<p>Is transparency a binding constraint in delivering health and
education?  Even though Rajasthan seems to have a strong environment
on recordkeeping and on availability of information to citizens,
Rajasthan hovers around the national average when it comes to teacher
absenteeism or health worker absenteeism. When a teacher does not show
up to work, or a teacher does not teach, citizens are very much
<i>aware</i> about the true state of affairs. There is not much that
RTI legislation adds to the information set of a citizen. This is in
contrast with (say) road building where citizens do not obviously know
how badly the road has been built, unless an effective RTI gives
access to details about how the road project was executed. In the case
of health or education, the core weakness in India lies in the lack of
`enforcement' - there is no cost for the front line provider to not do
his job.</p>

<p>There is some role, from a procurement perspective, for
cross-checking what government health facilities are buying, where an
RTI emphasis could have a modest impact. But when it comes to the core
business of principal-agent problems between State and civil servant
in the discretionary transaction-intensive public services of
education and health, it appears that transparency is not of
essence.</p>

<p>While a transparency agenda may not directly link to education and
health, there are strong indirect links:</p>

<ul>
<li> The emphasis on transparency has led to improvements in
recordkeeping at the panchayat level, which is surely a pre-condition
for any kind of competent functioning of local government.

<li> To the extent that a transparency focus reduces the private
benefits for local politicians and civil servants from public works,
it frees up mindshare and time for dealing with the difficult problems
of education and health.

<li> To the extent that the profit rate from a career in politics is
reduced, different kinds of people would self-select themselves into
such career options.

</ul>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>The RTI agenda does seem to have pushed the quality of
recordkeeping and improved the efficacy of public works programs in
Rajasthan. It has increased the sense amongst the civil service and
the politicians that they will be asked questions. Most importantly,
it has generated myriad changes in the mechanisms of public
administration - e.g. the use of photographs, the idea of
inspections. It appears that in this environment, the NREG can be
fairly effectively implemented. These changes in the thinking and
processes amongst civil servants and politicians constitute a
sustained impact - they do not rely on a continued engagement with
NGOs.</p>

<p>Though the emphasis on record keeping and transparency is not a
sufficient condition for better provision of public goods, it is a
necessary condition for better provision of a wide variety of public
goods.</p>

<p>Based on these experiences, it appears that Rajasthan has a
remarkable state of readiness for devolution of the three Fs. At the
same time, there are many challenges in moving from NREG-focused
systems and procedures to the larger problems of public goods. The
high quality recordkeeping in Rajasthan suggests that it can be an
ideal location for creating datasets about local government and public
goods.</p>

<p>A very interesting information-based strategy for improving local
government, on the scale of the full country, can be conceived: this
would involve an independent agency which fills out a questionnaire
about the <i>processes</i> and recordkeeping quality in a random
sample of villages in a state. The form used for inspections of GPs in
Rajasthan is a mature draft of this questionnaire. The national
press could highlight the strong states and the weak states and thus
put pressure on chief ministers. These scores could possibly be woven
into conditionalities of loans to states. This data could then be
linked up to public goods outcomes, thus offering measurement about
the links between improvements in processes of local government and
improvements in public goods.</p>

<p>Rajasthan holds many lessons for other states:</p>

<ul>
<li> States like Bihar would greatly benefit from Rajasthan-quality
  record keeping, including photograhs, minutes of panchayat level
  meetings such as the gram sabha, gram panchayat, village education
  society and other standing committee needs to be made the norm and
  implemented in other states and panchayats. The practice of
  videotaping proceedings (as in some blocks in Bihar) can also be
  encouraged.
<li> Many villages in Rajasthan have one or two civil servants (the
  <i>sachiv</i> is the secretary of the GP, and the <i>sahayak</i>
  is support staff for NREG districts). This human capacity is
  essential for record keeping. Redundant staff with inadequate
  training from other government departments such as the forest
  department are often being redeployed to these posts, which
  emphasises the need for training.
<li> Ultimately there is a synergistic relationship between
  recordkeeping quality and the political process. The
  Rajasthan outcomes require awareness amongst citizens in
  addition to a sustained reformative effort on the part of the
  bureacracy and state-level politicians.
